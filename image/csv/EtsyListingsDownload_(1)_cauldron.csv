Labradorite, also known as Spectrolite, is a Feldspar mineral.  Labradorite in a white matrix is often called ""Rainbow Moonstone"".

Blue crystals bring trust, faith, patience, and respect, lending the focus you need to become more sincere, more responsible, and become a more trustworthy individual.

Light blue crystals help us accept the life you have, develop patience, reconcile differences, or seek forgiveness. They are wonderful for recovery from addictions and other destructive patterns, help curbing tempers, and guide you to become more dependable and cheerful. Light blue crystals will also assist you in dealing with grief, letting go of the past, and curing guilt. Darker blue stones and crystals enhance the respect and compassion you have within yourself. They teach you discretion, humanity,  and honor, and also encourage you to act in a more charitable manner. They help you focus your efforts on service to others.

labradorite honors Arianrhod, the Welsh Goddess of the Moon and Stars. Her home is the Aurora Borealis, the place where souls go when their body dies and waits to be born once again. She is also a goddess of prophecy and dream.

Labradorite may also be used to honor Cerridwen, the Welsh Goddess of Inspiration and Knowledge. She rules the gifts of prophecy and magic, and powers death and rebirth. She is the guardian of spiritual transformation.

Wearing Labradorite as an amulet of protection is an ideal idea, because labradorite is a powerful Barrier Filter. Barrier crystals have fantastic abilities to help you focus and multiply your efforts to keep unwanted elements out of your life. Its crystalline structure provides strength in all directions, creating a barrier to attack from all directions at the same time.

Stones with the earth power of a filter, absorb positive energy flow but  keep negative energy away from you. They help you see the world in a ""glass half full""mode. They keep you focused on the positive in any situation, and keep you from being overwhelmed by the negative. With all of the technology in our world, stones and crystals that are filters also act to keep harmful electromagnetic emissions from draining our energy and health.

Labradorite is completely a Stone of Magic, a stone of shamans, psychics, diviners, healers, and all who seek the  knowledge and guidance of the universe . It is perfect for connecting your your higher self, intuition and psychic abilities.

Wearing or carrying Labradorite allows one's innate magical powers to surface. It enhances the mental and intuitive abilities of clairvoyance, telepathy, prophecy and coincidence control, and assists in communication with higher guides and spirits in accessing Akashic records, psychic readings and past-life recall. It provides an ease in moving between the worlds, and permits a safe and grounded return to the present. [Simmons, 225]

Labradorite is also the most powerful protector of the mineral kingdom, creating a shielding force throughout the aura and strengthening natural energies from within. It protects against the negativity and misfortunes of this world, and provides safe exploration into alternate levels of consciousness and in facilitating visionary experiences from the past or the future. [Ahsian, 226]

As a workplace stone, Labradorite brings out the best in people, making work life more congenial. It encourages courtesy and full attention to the customer, and assists part-time and temporary staff in becoming fully involved in a company. [Eason, 163]

Wearing or carrying Labradorite allows one's innate magical powers to surface. It enhances the mental and intuitive abilities of clairvoyance, telepathy, prophecy and coincidence control, and assists in communication with higher guides and spirits in accessing Akashic records, psychic readings and past-life recall. It provides an ease in moving between the worlds, and permits a safe and grounded return to the present. [Simmons, 225]

Labradorite helps develop the hands' sensitivity, making it useful for physiotherapists and all who use the power of touch to heal. [Megemont, 109]

Labradorite tempers the negative side of our personality, the traits and actions that rob our energy and may produce depression or shame. It assists in reducing anti-social, reckless or impulsive behavior in children, teenagers and adults who are easily led into trouble by others, and may aid in detoxifying the effects of tobacco, alcohol, and to a lesser degree, hard drugs. [Megemont, 109][Eason, 163]

Labradorite lowers blood pressure, reduces sensitivity to cold, and alleviates rheumatism and gout. [Eason, 163][Hall, 170][Gienger, 54]

It has been used in treatment for the eyes and brain disorders, to stimulate mental acuity, and to reduce stress and anxiety. It may also be soothing during menstruation, for PMS symptoms, and for pain relief. [Eason, 163][Melody, 368][Hall, 170]

Labradorite is beneficial to the lungs, and may assist with respiratory problems, bronchitis and colds. It assists in digestion, regulation, and metabolism. [Eason, 163][Melody, 368]

As the matriarch of the subconscious mind, Labradorite brings forgotten memories to light and facilitates their understanding. It encourages contemplation and introspection, bringing the clarity of intellectual thought and intuitive wisdom to help dispel illusion, determine the root cause of an issue, and bring one to peace. It is an uplifting crystal, helping to banish fears and insecurities while enhancing faith and reliance in oneself and trust in the universe. [Melody, 367][Hall, 170][Gienger, 54]

Labradorite calms an overactive mind and energizes the imagination, bringing in new ideas. [Hall, 170] 

It is a wonderful tool for returning joy and spontaneity back to one's life. It helps eliminate the emotional drain of daily routine or being weighed down by responsibility, and awakens a sense of adventure and change. [Eason, 163]

Labradorite is a powerful protector of the aura, preventing energy leakage, and others from tapping into and draining your personal energy. It ensures all elemental forces are empowered and proportional within one's system. [Ahsian, 226] 

It is also a useful tool in radionic analysis and treatment to help pinpoint problem areas. [Melody, 368][Hall, 170]

Labradorite's energy allows one to penetrate the veils of the Void, where all knowledge and possibility are held. It is the place of potential and the source of creation, and for shamans, magicians, and Light workers, Labradorite acts as a protective ally in recalling experiences from other realms, other times and other lives. It assists in moving between the worlds, and in bringing to this realm the creations which are for the highest good of all beings. [Ahsian, 226]

Referred to as the ""temple of the stars,"" Labradorite is thought to bring the light of other planetary beings to the soul of the user. Its labradorescence is believed to be of extra-terrestrial origins, and enclosed in the mineral to bring the evolved energies from other worlds to the Earth plane. [Melody, 367]

Chakras
Labradorite radiates a predominant blue crystal energy that stimulates the Throat Chakra, the voice of the body. It is, in essence, a pressure valve that allows the energy from the other chakras to be expressed. If it is blocked, or out of balance, it can affect the health of the other chakras. When the throat chakra is in balance and open, it allows for the expression of what we think and what we feel. We can communicate our ideas, beliefs, and emotions, bringing our personal truth out into the world. We have an easy flow of energy within the body and spirit. The energy that springs upward from the lower chakras can continue its path enabling free expression and natural release. Darker shades of blue encourage the power of truth, while lighter shades carry the power of flexibility, relaxation, and balance. Labradorite, with its iridescent flashes of color, can be very beneficial in uniting all of the chakras.

Golden Labradorite assists in opening the lower chakras during ritual or magical practices, while Spectrolite works with one's ""Rainbow Body"" to enhance awareness of the higher realms. [Simmons, 226]

Meditate with Golden Labradorite to open channels to the higher realms of archangels. Spiral through and above your hair to mend tears in your aura. [Eason, 102]

Meditating with Spectrolite raises consciousness and facilitates multi- and inter-dimensional journeying. Holding profound esoteric wisdom, it takes you into other lives and prepares the body and soul for ascension. [Hall II, 326]

Meditating with Labradorite allows one to recognize humanity as ""being of light,"" transcending limitations of the past and thoughts of the future, and embracing the infinite possibilities of the moment. It allows one to ""be"" and rest assured the light is always there, surrounding and pure. [Melody, 368]

The Divinatory meaning of Labradorite: You may have to temporarily make the best of a less-than-ideal situation, but soon will be able to do things your way. [Eason, 163]

Feng Shui
Labradorite utilizes Water energy, the energy of stillness, quiet strength, and purification. It embodies potentialities unrealized. It is yielding, formless, yet powerful. The Water element brings power of regeneration and rebirth. It is the energy of the circle of life. Use blue crystals to enhance any space that you use for repose, calm reflection, or prayer. Water energy is traditionally associated with the North area of a home or room. It is associated with the Career and Life Path area, its flowing energy assuring a balance of energy as your life unfolds and flows.

Legend and Lore
In ancient lore, Labradorite was considered to be a talismanic gem of winter, and in Oriental culture was known as a ""phenomenal gem"" to be worn on Saturdays. Phenomenal gems exhibited a moving line, star, or changes on the surface as the light varied, and was considered to bring good fortune to the wearer. [Kunz, 326, 333-334]
Native Inuit tribes of North America claim the first Labradorite fell from the Aurora Borealis from the fire of their ancestors. Another legend describes a brave Inuit warrior who struck Labradorite with his spear and created the Northern Lights",25,USD,2,"Everything_Else,Religious,chakra,healing,protectiion,crystal_grid,energy_grid,calming,divination,scrying,hecate,Earth,Samhain,Capricorn,Aquarius",Labradorite,https://img0.etsystatic.com/031/0/7575218/il_fullxfull.524060124_fd7r.jpg,,,,,"Custom Property",Stone,Labradorite

Chakra
Crown
Throat
Third Eye
Amethyst carries a high, sweet energy, particularly stimulating to the Third Eye, Crown and Etheric Chakras. [Ahsian, 29]

The Brow Chakra, also called the Third Eye, is the center of our perception and command. It directs our sight and everyday awareness of the world. Our consciousness is located here, and we relate to ourselves through this chakra. When the Brow Chakra is in balance our thoughts and internal communications within ourselves are healthy and vibrant. We are open to new ideas, dreams, and visions, and can control the flow of energy within all the chakras. The dark blue/purple crystals of indigo are used to treat imbalances of the Brow Chakra. It is a quiet color, one of mystery and wisdom and judgment.

The Crown Chakra is located at the top of the head, and is our gateway to the expanded universe beyond our bodies. It controls how we think, and how we respond to the world around us. It is the fountainhead of our beliefs and the source of our spirituality. It connects us to the higher planes of existence and is the source of universal energy and truth. When the Crown is in balance, our energies are in balance. We know our place in the universe and see things as they are. We are unruffled by setbacks, knowing they are an essential part of life.

Chalcedony also enhances listening skills and communication, encouraging reflection and meditation preparing one for action, and stimulates the mind to make new languages easier to learn. In addition, it is known to be of assistance in helping one hold back words that must be measured, so as not to feel regret later.

The triquetra is a religious symbol that is almost as well known as a pentagram. It is Latin for “three cornered” and is composed of there interlocking vesica piscis shapes.

Still widely used in Ireland, it has Celtic origins. It symbolizes love,honor,and protection. It is also known as a Trinity knot and some can be very elaborate or complex while some are simple and unadorned.

The triquetra symbolizes the power of three, which is frequently seen as a divine number. This symbol that is formed from the intersection of three circles can sometimes have a fourth circle woven through it. In this case, the fourth circle makes the significance of the symbolism stronger. It can connect the mind, body and soul and it represents the way the three individuals are part of one whole. The circle shows spiritual unity with the divine.

Some Christians use the triquetra to symbolize the father, son and holy spirit but this symbol pre dates Christianity, just like the cross, and has a myriad of meanings. It also shows magical, protective traits since it is one of those that can be drawn in one sweep of your pen without taking it off the paper, which adds a lot more power.

There are lots of meanings associated with the triquetra, some of them are:

The three sisters of The Morrighan
life,death and rebirth
Earth, sky and sea
Physical, mental and spiritual
Mother, father and child
Power, love and intellect
Creation, preservation and destruction
Thought, Feeling and emotion
Other world, mortal world and celestial world
Past, present and future
The three bridgits ( art, healing and metalsmithing )
The most common pagan meaning is that it represents the threefold nature of the goddess- maiden, mother, and crone.

Peridot

PeridotStone of Cycle Regulation
Peridot is a bit of a conundrum, it is one of the few stones found in only one color, but is known by three names: Peridot, Olivin and Chrysolith. It is told that the name Peridot is derived from the Greek word “peridona” with a meaning that runs along the lines of “giving plenty”.
The reason for the deep green color with a slight golden hue is due to fine traces of iron. The amount of iron is what gives the stone a range of color from yellow-green and olive to brownish green. The olive green stones are called Olivine, the yellow ones Chrysolite and the spring green are Peridot.

It is, in essence, a pressure valve that allows the energy from the other chakras to be expressed. If it is blocked, or out of balance, it can affect the health of the other chakras. When the throat chakra is in balance and open, it allows for the expression of what we think and what we feel. We can communicate our ideas, beliefs, and emotions, bringing our personal truth out into the world. We have an easy flow of energy within the body and spirit. The energy that springs upward from the lower chakras can continue its path enabling free expression and natural release. Darker shades of blue encourage the power of truth, while lighter shades carry the power of flexibility, relaxation, and balance. Labradorite, with its iridescent flashes of color, can be very beneficial in uniting all of the chakras. Golden Labradorite assists in opening the lower chakras during ritual or magical practices, while Spectrolite works with one's ""Rainbow Body"" to enhance awareness of the higher realms. [Simmons, 226] Meditate with Golden Labradorite to open channels to the higher realms of archangels. Spiral through and above your hair to mend tears in your aura. [Eason, 102] Meditating with Spectrolite raises consciousness and facilitates multi- and inter-dimensional journeying. Holding profound esoteric wisdom, it takes you into other lives and prepares the body and soul for ascension. [Hall II, 326] Meditating with Labradorite allows one to recognize humanity as ""being of light,"" transcending limitations of the past and thoughts of the future, and embracing the infinite possibilities of the moment. It allows one to ""be"" and rest assured the light is always there, surrounding and pure. [Melody, 368] The Divinatory meaning of Labradorite: You may have to temporarily make the best of a less-than-ideal situation, but soon will be able to do things your way. [Eason, 163] Feng Shui Labradorite utilizes Water energy, the energy of stillness, quiet strength, and purification. It embodies potentialities unrealized. It is yielding, formless, yet powerful. The Water element brings power of regeneration and rebirth. It is the energy of the circle of life. Use blue crystals to enhance any space that you use for repose, calm reflection, or prayer. Water energy is traditionally associated with the North area of a home or room. It is associated with the Career and Life Path area, its flowing energy assuring a balance of energy as your life unfolds and flows. Legend and Lore In ancient lore, Labradorite was considered to be a talismanic gem of winter, and in Oriental culture was known as a ""phenomenal gem"" to be worn on Saturdays. Phenomenal gems exhibited a moving line, star, or changes on the surface as the light varied, and was considered to bring good fortune to the wearer. [Kunz, 326, 333-334] Native Inuit tribes of North America claim the first Labradorite fell from the Aurora Borealis from the fire of their ancestors. Another legend describes a brave Inuit warrior who struck Labradorite with his spear and created the Northern Lights

This symbol that is formed from the intersection of three circles can sometimes have a fourth circle woven through it. In this case, the fourth circle makes the significance of the symbolism stronger. It can connect the mind, body and soul and it represents the way the three individuals are part of one whole. The circle shows spiritual unity with the divine.

Some Christians use the triquetra to symbolize the father, son and holy spirit but this symbol pre dates Christianity, just like the cross, and has a myriad of meanings. It also shows magical, protective traits since it is one of those that can be drawn in one sweep of your pen without taking it off the paper, which adds a lot more power.

The three sisters of The Morrighan
life,death and rebirth
Earth, sky and sea
Physical, mental and spiritual
Mother, father and child
Power, love and intellect
Creation, preservation and destruction
Thought, Feeling and emotion

Rutilated QuartzStone of Eliminating Destructive Patterns
Tourmaline or Tourmalinated Quartz is rock crystal (crystal quartz) which has grown together with black tourmaline, and the tourmaline has penetrated the quartz creating the description ‘tourmalinated’.
Energy: Projective
Quartz which is penetrated by black tourmaline crystals is often worn during rituals to stimulate astral projection. It is commonly used in rituals as a symbol of unity.
A powerful stone for protection and grounding, this stone is formed of needle-like inclusions of black tourmaline – powerful protection in its own right – imbedded in natural clear quartz – a high energy stone used to increase personal power. This fabulous shield-stone amplifies energy sent towards it. Then, depending on the desired intent of the wearer, this stone can either send that amplified energy back to the sender, much like a mirror spell; or even better, transmute any negativity into positive energy for the wearer. In addition, tourmalinated quartz aids to balance yin/yang energies and release negative patterns
Rutilated Quartz
Tourmaline quartz has been successfully used to treat disorders of the digestive tract and to detoxify the entire body. It develops it’s liberating power against negative energy most effectively in the shape of a sphere.

The triquetra is a religious symbol that is almost as well known as a pentagram. It is Latin for “three cornered” and is composed of there interlocking vesica piscis shapes.

 Still widely used in Ireland, it has Celtic origins. It symbolizes love,honor,and protection. It is also known as a Trinity knot and some can be very elaborate or complex while some are simple and unadorned.

The triquetra symbolizes the power of three, which is frequently seen as a divine number. This symbol that is formed from the intersection of three circles can sometimes have a fourth circle woven through it. In this case, the fourth circle makes the significance of the symbolism stronger.  It can connect the mind, body and soul and it represents the way the three individuals are part of one whole. The circle shows spiritual unity with the divine.

Some Christians use the triquetra to symbolize the father, son and holy spirit but this symbol pre dates Christianity, just like the cross, and has a myriad of meanings. It also shows magical, protective traits since it is one of those that can be drawn in one sweep of your pen without taking it off the paper, which adds a lot more power.

The three sisters of The Morrighan

labradorite honors Arianrhod, the Welsh Goddess of the Moon and Stars. Her home is the Aurora Borealis, the place where souls go when their body dies and waits to be born once again. She is also a goddess of prophecy and dream.

Labradorite may also be used to honor Cerridwen, the Welsh Goddess of Inspiration and Knowledge. She rules the gifts of prophecy and magic, and powers death and rebirth. She is the guardian of spiritual transformation.

Wearing Labradorite as an amulet of protection is an ideal idea, because labradorite is a powerful Barrier Filter. Barrier crystals have fantastic abilities to help you focus and multiply your efforts to keep unwanted elements out of your life. Its crystalline structure provides strength in all directions, creating a barrier to attack from all directions at the same time.

Stones with the earth power of a filter, absorb positive energy flow but keep negative energy away from you. They help you see the world in a ""glass half full""mode. They keep you focused on the positive in any situation, and keep you from being overwhelmed by the negative. With all of the technology in our world, stones and crystals that are filters also act to keep harmful electromagnetic emissions from draining our energy and health.

Labradorite is completely a Stone of Magic, a stone of shamans, psychics, diviners, healers, and all who seek the knowledge and guidance of the universe . It is perfect for connecting your your higher self, intuition and psychic abilities.

Wearing or carrying Labradorite allows one's innate magical powers to surface.

It provides an ease in moving between the worlds, and permits a safe and grounded return to the present. [Simmons, 225]

Labradorite is also the most powerful protector of the mineral kingdom, creating a shielding force throughout the aura and strengthening natural energies from within. It protects against the negativity and misfortunes of this world, and provides safe exploration into alternate levels of consciousness and in facilitating visionary experiences from the past or the future. [Ahsian, 226]

As a workplace stone, Labradorite brings out the best in people, making work life more congenial. It encourages courtesy and full attention to the customer, and assists part-time and temporary staff in becoming fully involved in a company. [Eason, 163]

Labradorite helps develop the hands' sensitivity, making it useful for physiotherapists and all who use the power of touch to heal. [Megemont, 109]

Labradorite tempers the negative side of our personality, the traits and actions that rob our energy and may produce depression or shame. It assists in reducing anti-social, reckless or impulsive behavior in children, teenagers and adults who are easily led into trouble by others, and may aid in detoxifying the effects of tobacco, alcohol, and to a lesser degree, hard drugs. [Megemont, 109][Eason, 163]

Labradorite lowers blood pressure, reduces sensitivity to cold, and alleviates rheumatism and gout. [Eason, 163][Hall, 170][Gienger, 54]

It has been used in treatment for the eyes and brain disorders, to stimulate mental acuity, and to reduce stress and anxiety. It may also be soothing during menstruation, for PMS symptoms, and for pain relief. [Eason, 163][Melody, 368][Hall, 170]

Labradorite is beneficial to the lungs, and may assist with respiratory problems, bronchitis and colds. It assists in digestion, regulation, and metabolism. [Eason, 163][Melody, 368]

As the matriarch of the subconscious mind, Labradorite brings forgotten memories to light and facilitates their understanding. It encourages contemplation and introspection, bringing the clarity of intellectual thought and intuitive wisdom to help dispel illusion, determine the root cause of an issue, and bring one to peace. It is an uplifting crystal, helping to banish fears and insecurities while enhancing faith and reliance in oneself and trust in the universe. [Melody, 367][Hall, 170][Gienger, 54]

Labradorite calms an overactive mind and energizes the imagination, bringing in new ideas. [Hall, 170]

It is a wonderful tool for returning joy and spontaneity back to one's life. It helps eliminate the emotional drain of daily routine or being weighed down by responsibility, and awakens a sense of adventure and change. [Eason, 163]

Labradorite is a powerful protector of the aura, preventing energy leakage, and others from tapping into and draining your personal energy. It ensures all elemental forces are empowered and proportional within one's system. [Ahsian, 226]

It is also a useful tool in radionic analysis and treatment to help pinpoint problem areas. [Melody, 368][Hall, 170]

Labradorite's energy allows one to penetrate the veils of the Void, where all knowledge and possibility are held. It is the place of potential and the source of creation, and for shamans, magicians, and Light workers, Labradorite acts as a protective ally in recalling experiences from other realms, other times and other lives. It assists in moving between the worlds, and in bringing to this realm the creations which are for the highest good of all beings. [Ahsian, 226]

Referred to as the ""temple of the stars,"" Labradorite is thought to bring the light of other planetary beings to the soul of the user. Its labradorescence is believed to be of extra-terrestrial origins, and enclosed in the mineral to bring the evolved energies from other worlds to the Earth plane. [Melody, 367]

Chakras
Labradorite radiates a predominant blue crystal energy that stimulates the Throat Chakra, the voice of the body. It is, in essence, a pressure valve that allows the energy from the other chakras to be expressed. If it is blocked, or out of balance, it can affect the health of the other chakras. When the throat chakra is in balance and open, it allows for the expression of what we think and what we feel. We can communicate our ideas, beliefs, and emotions, bringing our personal truth out into the world. We have an easy flow of energy within the body and spirit. The energy that springs upward from the lower chakras can continue its path enabling free expression and natural release. Darker shades of blue encourage the power of truth, while lighter shades carry the power of flexibility, relaxation, and balance. Labradorite, with its iridescent flashes of color, can be very beneficial in uniting all of the chakras.

Golden Labradorite assists in opening the lower chakras during ritual or magical practices, while Spectrolite works with one's ""Rainbow Body"" to enhance awareness of the higher realms. [Simmons, 226]

Meditate with Golden Labradorite to open channels to the higher realms of archangels. Spiral through and above your hair to mend tears in your aura. [Eason, 102]

Meditating with Spectrolite raises consciousness and facilitates multi- and inter-dimensional journeying. Holding profound esoteric wisdom, it takes you into other lives and prepares the body and soul for ascension. [Hall II, 326]

Meditating with Labradorite allows one to recognize humanity as ""being of light,"" transcending limitations of the past and thoughts of the future, and embracing the infinite possibilities of the moment. It allows one to ""be"" and rest assured the light is always there, surrounding and pure. [Melody, 368]

The Divinatory meaning of Labradorite: You may have to temporarily make the best of a less-than-ideal situation, but soon will be able to do things your way. [Eason, 163]

Feng Shui
Labradorite utilizes Water energy, the energy of stillness, quiet strength, and purification. It embodies potentialities unrealized. It is yielding, formless, yet powerful. The Water element brings power of regeneration and rebirth. It is the energy of the circle of life. Use blue crystals to enhance any space that you use for repose, calm reflection, or prayer. Water energy is traditionally associated with the North area of a home or room. It is associated with the Career and Life Path area, its flowing energy assuring a balance of energy as your life unfolds and flows.

Legend and Lore
In ancient lore, Labradorite was considered to be a talismanic gem of winter, and in Oriental culture was known as a ""phenomenal gem"" to be worn on Saturdays. Phenomenal gems exhibited a moving line, star, or changes on the surface as the light varied, and was considered to bring good fortune to the wearer. [Kunz, 326, 333-334]

I see a lot of car bags out there that include high energy/frequency stones that really shouldn't be kept in your car. There are enough hyped up, stressed out, and people paying attention to their phones, stereo, other people in their vehicles etc., don't make yourself one of those inadvertently. 
Stones I commonly see in car bags that should be avoided are: Clear quartz, smoky quartz, amethyst, herkimer diamonds etc..
I also see stones like rainbow moonstone, which are excellent for your boat, but don't really have much of a benefit for travel protection on land.
I keep a muslin bag of the following stones under each seat, as well as hanging from my rear-view mirror for safer traveling. I also keep a 3 inch piece of raw black tourmaline in my console, the energy of anything bigger is too distracting to the driver. I use a natural fiber bag to allow the energies of the stones to flow freely. A man-made fiber will confine the energy of the stones within the bag, and won't do you much good.
Selenite for safe boundaries, cleansing, guides, peaceful environment, and strengthening your auric field.
Rose Quartz for attracting loving energies and protecting your auric field.
Gold Tiger's Eye, Red Tiger's Eye and Blue Tiger's Eye to protect and energize your solar plexus, root and throat chakra to help you to safely execute your will as it relates to yours and your passengers safety.
Tiger Iron for a strong connection to the Earth for grounding and protection.

COLOR ASSOCIATIONS AND SYMBOLS

Color energies are useful in many ways. One of the most basic ways to use color symbolism in magick is to select candles of the color appropriate to your purpose. The power of color may be added at any point in rituals and spells to enhance the symbolism, and thus the power of the spell.

For example, you can add the power of color to your magick with the use of things like:
* Candles, Altar Cloth & Flowers for spells and rituals.
* Fabric and components for Amulets, Talismans, Dream Pillows, etc.
* Food coloring choices in Bath Salts.
* Label/Container choices for brews, teas, essential oils etc. *Meditations on colors for reaching specific chakras, or areas for psychic development. *Garments for ceremonies or simply on days when you wish to attract (or deflect) certain energies.
*Colored papers and inks for written spells.
*Awareness of colors you select in your decor and environment.

As with most things magickal, how you feel about the color, and what your aims are, will be the most important guide. If a color feels right to use for a purpose, even if it is not listed here, use it!

COLOR ASSOCIATIONS AND SYMBOLS

Color energies are useful in many ways. One of the most basic ways to use color symbolism in magick is to select candles of the color appropriate to your purpose. The power of color may be added at any point in rituals and spells to enhance the symbolism, and thus the power of the spell.

For example, you can add the power of color to your magick with the use of things like:
* Candles, Altar Cloth & Flowers for spells and rituals.
* Fabric and components for Amulets, Talismans, Dream Pillows, etc.
* Food coloring choices in Bath Salts.
* Label/Container choices for brews, teas, essential oils etc. *Meditations on colors for reaching specific chakras, or areas for psychic development. *Garments for ceremonies or simply on days when you wish to attract (or deflect) certain energies.
*Colored papers and inks for written spells.
*Awareness of colors you select in your decor and environment.

As with most things magickal, how you feel about the color, and what your aims are, will be the most important guide. If a color feels right to use for a purpose, even if it is not listed here, use it!

"Quit Smoking Help Chakra Bags Set Heart Chakra Solar Plexus Chakra Throat Chakra 3rd third 4th fourth 5th fifth metaphysical new age reike","Quit Smoking Stone Chakra Helper Bags

This listing is for a heart chakra basic bag set, a throat chakra basic bag set and a solar plexus basic bag set,(which includes all of the stones listed below, pink satin bag, green satin bag, blue satin bag, gold satin bag and 3 muslin bags), instructions, stone properties printouts, example pictures so that you can easily identify your stones,  and chakra information printouts.

Quitting smoking can be a very hard thing to do. Stones can be wonderful allies to help you with this process.  The first thing that you need to work on is getting your heart chakra functioning correctly. Almost all smoking addictions come from a heart chakra imbalance. Taking care of these chakras will benefit all of your other chakras, as well as assist you with other issues associated with those chakras.

The stones included in the heart chakra bag are:
Green Calcite and Rose Quartz (Cleanse/Clear)
Emerald and Rhodochrosite (activate)
Jade and Rhodonite (Balance)
Malachite (align)
Watermelon Tourmaline (fine tune)


 The other things that will need to be addressed is will power, (solar plexus) and self control, (throat chakra). Note that these are the chakras directly above and below the heart chakra, where the main issue is.  When there is an imbalance in a chakra, it will also negatively affect the chakras directly above and below it.

Stones included in your solar plexus chakra bag:
Honey calcite (cleanser) (make sure you are not using golden calcite, lemon calcite or citrine calcite, as these are activators, not cleansers).
Citrine druze (activate and energize) (use yellow vaireties, not orange)
Pyrite (energizer)
Amber (balance and sooth)
Tiger eye to fine tune, (make sure you have properly cleansed, activated, energized, balanced and soothered first, or tiger's eye can amplify any issues you have related to the solar plexus chakra, especially fears.)
 
Stones included in your throat chakra bag:
Blue Calcite (cleanser)
Blue Lace Agate (gentle activator)
Blue Quartz (strong activator)
Turquoise (align and balance)
Lapis (activate and energize)
Sodalite (activate and energize)
 
Lapis and sodalite can be third eye activators in some people, so take note if you are experiencing third eye activity when using these stones.
 
To use the stones, simply place the stones one at a time on the appropriate chakra for no more than 5 minutes each. If the stones roll off of you, they're done, don't put them back on. If you want to seriously amp up the effectiveness of your chakra work, say the affirmations or chant the correct sounds for that chakra while using the stones. You can find this information on these three chakras.

Please make sure you are properly caring for your stones, and they will help care for you.
You can learn how to do that, as well as your auric field, spaces, and other objects, here: https://www.facebook.com/notes/morrighans-cauldron/energetic-hygiene-the-4-cs/670352319751258

Picture is an example of the type and size of stones you will receive. As they are each a work of mother nature's art, there will be variances of coloring, shading and patterning.
 
Other things you can do to help are wearing the colors for that chakra on that chakra, (pink and green for your heart chakra, yellow or gold for your solar plexus chakra, and blue for your throat chakra.)
 
You can wear a choker necklace with throat chakra stones, a necklace with heart chakra stones over your heart chakra, and a long necklace with solar plexus stones that hang over your solar plexus.  (Some people have a hard time with the energy of citrine directly on their solar plexus chakra, especially at first. If this happens to you, you can simply hold the citrine in your receptive hand, (usually the opposite hand of which you write with).
 
Another thing you can do is wear rings on the corresponding fingers of these chakras, correct stones of course.  Take a look here to see which finger corresponds to which chakra:

Location:
The fourth chakra is located in the center of the chest around the area of the heart.

Metaphysical:
This chakra is represented by the green Anahata Mandala (un-struck sound).

The lower three Chakras relate to personal energy and the physical. The higher three Chakras relate to the self within, collective conscious of higher guidance, the spiritual. 

The fourth chakra is the gateway where the other main six Chakras in our physical bodies converge; it is the foundation of the astral body the connection between our physical and our spiritual body, love is it’s driving force.

It influences forgiveness, compassion, empathy, trust, equilibrium and ease within our life. It can help us to get in touch with nature and help us connect to the plant world.

When our heart chakra is balanced and in harmony with the lower and upper Chakras, we are able to achieve balance which allows us to give and receive unconditional love. This brings us peace within ourselves and also the world around us. It assists us in rejuvenation, rebirth, success, growth, prosperity, development and rebirth, bringing balance to all parts of ourselves, which can help us to help others.

A lack of balance in the fourth chakra can be due to a lack of balance in the first three Chakras. If this chakra is not functioning correctly, it can create harmful effects in the physical, which can manifest as allergies, circulatory, lung or heart problems and many others. Issues with this chakra can cause to become emotionally unstable, which can create obsessions, feelings of being unloved, suspicious, feeling like a martyr, and repress things that need to be addressed.

Physical:
This chakra physically influences the lungs, thymus, circulation, the endocrine and immune systems, heart, shoulders, arms, diaphragm, skin, upper back, breasts, asthma, allergies, tension between shoulder blades.

Affirmations:
I freely and easily give and receive love.
I totally forgive myself and others for all past errors and judgments.
I am worthy of love.
I am loving to myself and others.
There is an infinite supply of love.
I live balanced with others.
I deeply and completely love and accept myself.
I nurture my inner child.
I am wanted and loved.
I live in balance, in a state of gracefulness and gratitude.

Other things you can do to help are wearing the colors of pink and green for your heart chakra. You can also wear a necklace with heart chakra stones over your heart chakra.

Some people have a hard time with the energy of stones directly on their chakras, especially at first. If this happens to you, you can simply hold the stone in your receptive hand, (usually the opposite hand of which you write with).

Another thing you can do is wear rings on the corresponding fingers of these chakras, correct stones of course. Take a look here to see which finger corresponds to which chakra:

If you'd like to make your own bag:
You may already have some of the stones. Just make sure you only use the stones for one purpose at a time, so their energies are properly directed and not scattered. You should be taking care of each chakra on a regular basis anyways, and the stones listed for each chakra below are the basic stones you need to do that with.

Keep the stones in an appropriately colored bag of manmade fibers, to keep ouside influences on your stones to a minimum. Since stones prefer to be touching natural fibers, I place my chakra stones inside muslin bags, then place that inside the colored bags.

All of the stones listed I recommend using in raw form, with the exception of malachite, which can be quite toxic and should be used in a polished form and kept out of the reach of children and animals. 

If you find raw stone's energies too harsh for you, you can start out with polsihed. A handful of stones are actually more potent in polished form, like fluorite and carnelian. This is why my basic bags contain a mix of both types. I prefer raw stones of at least the size of a half dollar for chakra work. There are a few stones that have more potent energies where a smaller stone is fine. Of those listed, malachite, watermelon tourmaline, jade and rhodochrosite can be used in a smaller size stone.

Please make sure you are properly caring for your stones, and they will help care for you.
You can learn how to do that, as well as your auric field, spaces, and other objects, here: https://www.facebook.com/notes/morrighans-cauldron/energetic-hygiene-the-4-cs/670352319751258",112.5,USD,10,"Everything_Else,Religious,Smoking_Sugar_Love,Marijuana,Physical_Health,Grounding_Stability,Prosperity,Self_Acceptance,Trust,thymus,Heart_lungs,circulatory_system,arms_hands,venus_sun,Gemini_Libra","watermelon tourmaline,malachite,rose quartz,green calcite,rhodonite rhodochrosite,emerald jade,pink green,Aquarius touch,Antelope dove birds,love,rejuvenation,rebirth success growth",https://img0.etsystatic.com/047/0/7575218/il_fullxfull.740714116_pbtp.jpg,,,,

Labradorite, also known as Spectrolite, is a Feldspar mineral.  Labradorite in a white matrix is often called ""Rainbow Moonstone"".

Blue crystals bring trust, faith, patience, and respect, lending the focus you need to become more sincere, more responsible, and become a more trustworthy individual.

Light blue crystals help us accept the life you have, develop patience, reconcile differences, or seek forgiveness. They are wonderful for recovery from addictions and other destructive patterns, help curbing tempers, and guide you to become more dependable and cheerful. Light blue crystals will also assist you in dealing with grief, letting go of the past, and curing guilt. Darker blue stones and crystals enhance the respect and compassion you have within yourself. They teach you discretion, humanity,  and honor, and also encourage you to act in a more charitable manner. They help you focus your efforts on service to others.

labradorite honors Arianrhod, the Welsh Goddess of the Moon and Stars. Her home is the Aurora Borealis, the place where souls go when their body dies and waits to be born once again. She is also a goddess of prophecy and dream.

Labradorite may also be used to honor Cerridwen, the Welsh Goddess of Inspiration and Knowledge. She rules the gifts of prophecy and magic, and powers death and rebirth. She is the guardian of spiritual transformation.

Wearing Labradorite as an amulet of protection is an ideal idea, because labradorite is a powerful Barrier Filter. Barrier crystals have fantastic abilities to help you focus and multiply your efforts to keep unwanted elements out of your life. Its crystalline structure provides strength in all directions, creating a barrier to attack from all directions at the same time.

Stones with the earth power of a filter, absorb positive energy flow but  keep negative energy away from you. They help you see the world in a ""glass half full""mode. They keep you focused on the positive in any situation, and keep you from being overwhelmed by the negative. With all of the technology in our world, stones and crystals that are filters also act to keep harmful electromagnetic emissions from draining our energy and health.

Labradorite is completely a Stone of Magic, a stone of shamans, psychics, diviners, healers, and all who seek the  knowledge and guidance of the universe . It is perfect for connecting your your higher self, intuition and psychic abilities.

Wearing or carrying Labradorite allows one's innate magical powers to surface. It enhances the mental and intuitive abilities of clairvoyance, telepathy, prophecy and coincidence control, and assists in communication with higher guides and spirits in accessing Akashic records, psychic readings and past-life recall. It provides an ease in moving between the worlds, and permits a safe and grounded return to the present. [Simmons, 225]

Labradorite is also the most powerful protector of the mineral kingdom, creating a shielding force throughout the aura and strengthening natural energies from within. It protects against the negativity and misfortunes of this world, and provides safe exploration into alternate levels of consciousness and in facilitating visionary experiences from the past or the future. [Ahsian, 226]

As a workplace stone, Labradorite brings out the best in people, making work life more congenial. It encourages courtesy and full attention to the customer, and assists part-time and temporary staff in becoming fully involved in a company. [Eason, 163]

Labradorite tempers the negative side of our personality, the traits and actions that rob our energy and may produce depression or shame. It assists in reducing anti-social, reckless or impulsive behavior in children, teenagers and adults who are easily led into trouble by others, and may aid in detoxifying the effects of tobacco, alcohol, and to a lesser degree, hard drugs. [Megemont, 109][Eason, 163]

Labradorite lowers blood pressure, reduces sensitivity to cold, and alleviates rheumatism and gout. [Eason, 163][Hall, 170][Gienger, 54]

It has been used in treatment for the eyes and brain disorders, to stimulate mental acuity, and to reduce stress and anxiety. It may also be soothing during menstruation, for PMS symptoms, and for pain relief. [Eason, 163][Melody, 368][Hall, 170]

Labradorite is beneficial to the lungs, and may assist with respiratory problems, bronchitis and colds. It assists in digestion, regulation, and metabolism. [Eason, 163][Melody, 368]

As the matriarch of the subconscious mind, Labradorite brings forgotten memories to light and facilitates their understanding. It encourages contemplation and introspection, bringing the clarity of intellectual thought and intuitive wisdom to help dispel illusion, determine the root cause of an issue, and bring one to peace. It is an uplifting crystal, helping to banish fears and insecurities while enhancing faith and reliance in oneself and trust in the universe. [Melody, 367][Hall, 170][Gienger, 54]

Labradorite calms an overactive mind and energizes the imagination, bringing in new ideas. [Hall, 170] 

It is a wonderful tool for returning joy and spontaneity back to one's life. It helps eliminate the emotional drain of daily routine or being weighed down by responsibility, and awakens a sense of adventure and change. [Eason, 163]

Labradorite is a powerful protector of the aura, preventing energy leakage, and others from tapping into and draining your personal energy. It ensures all elemental forces are empowered and proportional within one's system. [Ahsian, 226] 

It is also a useful tool in radionic analysis and treatment to help pinpoint problem areas. [Melody, 368][Hall, 170]

Labradorite's energy allows one to penetrate the veils of the Void, where all knowledge and possibility are held. It is the place of potential and the source of creation, and for shamans, magicians, and Light workers, Labradorite acts as a protective ally in recalling experiences from other realms, other times and other lives. It assists in moving between the worlds, and in bringing to this realm the creations which are for the highest good of all beings. [Ahsian, 226]

Referred to as the ""temple of the stars,"" Labradorite is thought to bring the light of other planetary beings to the soul of the user. Its labradorescence is believed to be of extra-terrestrial origins, and enclosed in the mineral to bring the evolved energies from other worlds to the Earth plane. [Melody, 367]

Chakras
Labradorite radiates a predominant blue crystal energy that stimulates the Throat Chakra, the voice of the body. It is, in essence, a pressure valve that allows the energy from the other chakras to be expressed. If it is blocked, or out of balance, it can affect the health of the other chakras. When the throat chakra is in balance and open, it allows for the expression of what we think and what we feel. We can communicate our ideas, beliefs, and emotions, bringing our personal truth out into the world. We have an easy flow of energy within the body and spirit. The energy that springs upward from the lower chakras can continue its path enabling free expression and natural release. Darker shades of blue encourage the power of truth, while lighter shades carry the power of flexibility, relaxation, and balance. Labradorite, with its iridescent flashes of color, can be very beneficial in uniting all of the chakras.

Golden Labradorite assists in opening the lower chakras during ritual or magical practices, while Spectrolite works with one's ""Rainbow Body"" to enhance awareness of the higher realms. [Simmons, 226]

Meditate with Golden Labradorite to open channels to the higher realms of archangels. Spiral through and above your hair to mend tears in your aura. [Eason, 102]

Meditating with Spectrolite raises consciousness and facilitates multi- and inter-dimensional journeying. Holding profound esoteric wisdom, it takes you into other lives and prepares the body and soul for ascension. [Hall II, 326]

Meditating with Labradorite allows one to recognize humanity as ""being of light,"" transcending limitations of the past and thoughts of the future, and embracing the infinite possibilities of the moment. It allows one to ""be"" and rest assured the light is always there, surrounding and pure. [Melody, 368]

The Divinatory meaning of Labradorite: You may have to temporarily make the best of a less-than-ideal situation, but soon will be able to do things your way. [Eason, 163]

Feng Shui
Labradorite utilizes Water energy, the energy of stillness, quiet strength, and purification. It embodies potentialities unrealized. It is yielding, formless, yet powerful. The Water element brings power of regeneration and rebirth. It is the energy of the circle of life. Use blue crystals to enhance any space that you use for repose, calm reflection, or prayer. Water energy is traditionally associated with the North area of a home or room. It is associated with the Career and Life Path area, its flowing energy assuring a balance of energy as your life unfolds and flows.

Legend and Lore
In ancient lore, Labradorite was considered to be a talismanic gem of winter, and in Oriental culture was known as a ""phenomenal gem"" to be worn on Saturdays. Phenomenal gems exhibited a moving line, star, or changes on the surface as the light varied, and was considered to bring good fortune to the wearer. [Kunz, 326, 333-334]
Native Inuit tribes of North America claim the first Labradorite fell from the Aurora Borealis from the fire of their ancestors. Another legend describes a brave Inuit warrior who struck Labradorite with his spear and created the Northern Lights

Cleansing Your CHAKRAS

Yes, there a a whole slew of stones that are associated with each chakra, but there are steps to working with your chakras.

First and foremost, you cleanse your chakras, get all of that nasty, icky, dirty, energy out.

If you activate a dirty chakra, you are just activating all of the nasty stuff that is there.

If you energize a dirty chakra, you are just amplifying all of the problems related to that chakra that you are experiencing, please don't do that to yourself.

Energy can not flow correctly within a dirty chakra, nor can it flow correctly between dirty chakras.


Everyone also seems to forget about the importance of your Earth chakra, (this is the chakra that is about grounding, among other things, it connects to your root chakra, but your root chakra is not what grounds you), as well as pumping physical energy into your chakra system, and your high crown chakra, (this is where your divine/cosmic/spiritual energy comes into your chakra system at.


Think of your high crown chakra as your shower head, and your Earth chakra as your shower drain. If the water pressure sucks, your not going to get a very good shower of divine/cosmic/spiritual energy are you?

If your Earth chakra isn't functioning correctly, then all of that nasty gunk in your chakras and auric field isn't being grounded into the Earth to be transmuted into something helpful, but rather backing up into your root chakra, and on up, can you say gross y'all?


If you do nothing else with your chakras, keep them clean, 7-10 minutes a day to cleanse your chakras, that's it, easy.

Simply lay down and place the stones on your chakras, from Earth chakra (2 -3 feet below your feet, stones can be placed at your feet), to high crown, (generally 6 - 18 inches above your head, place the stone in this area when you are laying down,) leave them on for 7-10 minutes, (If they roll off, they're done, don't put them back on), take them off in reverse order and your done, easy.

Just make sure you are properly preparing your stones before you use them. Click here for instructions on how to do that: 
https://www.facebook.com/notes/morrighans-cauldron/energetic-hygiene-the-4-cs/670352319751258


Here are the correct stones to cleanse your chakras:


Earth Chakra: Smoky Quartz


Root Chakra: Red Calcite


Sacral Chakra: Orange Calcite


Solar Plexus Chakra: Honey Calcite (don't use, gold, citrine, lemon etc. calcite, these are activators, not cleansers)


Heart Chakra: Green Calcite AND Rose Quartz (your heart chakra is pink on the inside, spiritual, and green on the outside, physical, and both parts need to be addressed.)


Throat Chakra: Blue Calcite


Third Eye Chakra: Predominantly purple and green fluorite. (The best is from Brazil, Fluorite from China is a bit lazy, and Fluorite from Russia is very, very strong, bossy and is best suited to high magik practices).


Crown Chakra: Clear Calcite (not optical calcite, optical calcite should NEVER be placed on a chakra within your physical body and not crystal calcite, which is an activator).


High Crown Chakra: Quartz or Selenite

Get into the habit of practicing proper energetic hygiene on your chakras and auric field, before even thinking about activating, energizing, balancing and fine tuning your chakras. 

Do not use the stones you use to cleanse your chakras and auric field for other purposes, or share them with other people, it would be like sharing a toothbrush, yuck!",75,USD,9,"Everything_Else,Religious,Wicca,Witchcraft,Witch,stone_whisperer,sacred,Wiccan,magick,magik,new_age,stone_magik,chakra,auric_field,sacred_stones","auric field,energetic hygiene,energy hygiene,personal hygiene,Selenite,Blue Calcite,Rose Quartz,Green Calcite,Smoky Quartz Red Calcite Orange Calcite,Honey Calcite,Clear White Calcite,Purple Green Fluorite,chakra cleansing with stones",https://img0.etsystatic.com/050/0/7575218/il_fullxfull.702109322_lkuz.jpg,,,,

Labradorite

Chakras – Root, Solar Plexus Crown and Brow
Deities: Arianhod, Cerridwen
Element – Water, Air
Energy: Receptive
Gender: Feminine
Planet – Uranus
Zodiac - Leo, Scorpio, Sagittarius

Intentions: ""temple of the stars"", brain disorders, stimulate mental activity, relieves stress & anxiety, healthy digestion, intuition, psychic development, esoteric wisdom, help with subconscious issues, mental illumination, eyes, regulates metabolism, balances hormones, menstrual tension, colds, gout, rheumatism, blood pressure, transformation, clear, balance and protect the aura, clarity, insight, destiny, success, dream recall, divination, psychic arts, higher self, change, strength, perseverance, raises consciousness, spiritual grounding, truth behind illusions, banishes fears and insecurities, imagination, overactive mind, enthusiasm and new ideas.

Labradorite, also known as Spectrolite, is a Feldspar mineral. Labradorite in a white matrix is often called ""Rainbow Moonstone"".

Blue crystals bring trust, faith, patience, and respect, lending the focus you need to become more sincere, more responsible, and become a more trustworthy individual.

Light blue crystals help us accept the life you have, develop patience, reconcile differences, or seek forgiveness. They are wonderful for recovery from addictions and other destructive patterns, help curbing tempers, and guide you to become more dependable and cheerful. Light blue crystals will also assist you in dealing with grief, letting go of the past, and curing guilt. Darker blue stones and crystals enhance the respect and compassion you have within yourself. They teach you discretion, humanity, and honor, and also encourage you to act in a more charitable manner. They help you focus your efforts on service to others.

labradorite honors Arianrhod, the Welsh Goddess of the Moon and Stars. Her home is the Aurora Borealis, the place where souls go when their body dies and waits to be born once again. She is also a goddess of prophecy and dream.

Labradorite may also be used to honor Cerridwen, the Welsh Goddess of Inspiration and Knowledge. She rules the gifts of prophecy and magic, and powers death and rebirth. She is the guardian of spiritual transformation.

Wearing Labradorite as an amulet of protection is an ideal idea, because labradorite is a powerful Barrier Filter. Barrier crystals have fantastic abilities to help you focus and multiply your efforts to keep unwanted elements out of your life. Its crystalline structure provides strength in all directions, creating a barrier to attack from all directions at the same time.

Stones with the earth power of a filter, absorb positive energy flow but keep negative energy away from you. They help you see the world in a ""glass half full""mode. They keep you focused on the positive in any situation, and keep you from being overwhelmed by the negative. With all of the technology in our world, stones and crystals that are filters also act to keep harmful electromagnetic emissions from draining our energy and health.

Labradorite is completely a Stone of Magic, a stone of shamans, psychics, diviners, healers, and all who seek the knowledge and guidance of the universe . It is perfect for connecting your your higher self, intuition and psychic abilities.

Wearing or carrying Labradorite allows one's innate magical powers to surface. It enhances the mental and intuitive abilities of clairvoyance, telepathy, prophecy and coincidence control, and assists in communication with higher guides and spirits in accessing Akashic records, psychic readings and past-life recall. It provides an ease in moving between the worlds, and permits a safe and grounded return to the present. [Simmons, 225]

Labradorite is also the most powerful protector of the mineral kingdom, creating a shielding force throughout the aura and strengthening natural energies from within. It protects against the negativity and misfortunes of this world, and provides safe exploration into alternate levels of consciousness and in facilitating visionary experiences from the past or the future. [Ahsian, 226]

As a workplace stone, Labradorite brings out the best in people, making work life more congenial. It encourages courtesy and full attention to the customer, and assists part-time and temporary staff in becoming fully involved in a company. [Eason, 163]

Wearing or carrying Labradorite allows one's innate magical powers to surface.

Labradorite helps develop the hands' sensitivity, making it useful for physiotherapists and all who use the power of touch to heal. [Megemont, 109]

Labradorite tempers the negative side of our personality, the traits and actions that rob our energy and may produce depression or shame. It assists in reducing anti-social, reckless or impulsive behavior in children, teenagers and adults who are easily led into trouble by others, and may aid in detoxifying the effects of tobacco, alcohol, and to a lesser degree, hard drugs. [Megemont, 109][Eason, 163]

Labradorite lowers blood pressure, reduces sensitivity to cold, and alleviates rheumatism and gout. [Eason, 163][Hall, 170][Gienger, 54]

It has been used in treatment for the eyes and brain disorders, to stimulate mental acuity, and to reduce stress and anxiety. It may also be soothing during menstruation, for PMS symptoms, and for pain relief. [Eason, 163][Melody, 368][Hall, 170]

Labradorite is beneficial to the lungs, and may assist with respiratory problems, bronchitis and colds. It assists in digestion, regulation, and metabolism. [Eason, 163][Melody, 368]

As the matriarch of the subconscious mind, Labradorite brings forgotten memories to light and facilitates their understanding. It encourages contemplation and introspection, bringing the clarity of intellectual thought and intuitive wisdom to help dispel illusion, determine the root cause of an issue, and bring one to peace. It is an uplifting crystal, helping to banish fears and insecurities while enhancing faith and reliance in oneself and trust in the universe. [Melody, 367][Hall, 170][Gienger, 54]

Labradorite calms an overactive mind and energizes the imagination, bringing in new ideas. [Hall, 170]

It is a wonderful tool for returning joy and spontaneity back to one's life. It helps eliminate the emotional drain of daily routine or being weighed down by responsibility, and awakens a sense of adventure and change. [Eason, 163]

Labradorite is a powerful protector of the aura, preventing energy leakage, and others from tapping into and draining your personal energy. It ensures all elemental forces are empowered and proportional within one's system. [Ahsian, 226]

It is also a useful tool in radionic analysis and treatment to help pinpoint problem areas. [Melody, 368][Hall, 170]

Labradorite's energy allows one to penetrate the veils of the Void, where all knowledge and possibility are held. It is the place of potential and the source of creation, and for shamans, magicians, and Light workers, Labradorite acts as a protective ally in recalling experiences from other realms, other times and other lives. It assists in moving between the worlds, and in bringing to this realm the creations which are for the highest good of all beings. [Ahsian, 226]

Referred to as the ""temple of the stars,"" Labradorite is thought to bring the light of other planetary beings to the soul of the user. Its labradorescence is believed to be of extra-terrestrial origins, and enclosed in the mineral to bring the evolved energies from other worlds to the Earth plane. [Melody, 367]

Chakras
Labradorite radiates a predominant blue crystal energy that stimulates the Throat Chakra, the voice of the body. It is, in essence, a pressure valve that allows the energy from the other chakras to be expressed. If it is blocked, or out of balance, it can affect the health of the other chakras. When the throat chakra is in balance and open, it allows for the expression of what we think and what we feel. We can communicate our ideas, beliefs, and emotions, bringing our personal truth out into the world. We have an easy flow of energy within the body and spirit. The energy that springs upward from the lower chakras can continue its path enabling free expression and natural release. Darker shades of blue encourage the power of truth, while lighter shades carry the power of flexibility, relaxation, and balance. Labradorite, with its iridescent flashes of color, can be very beneficial in uniting all of the chakras.

Golden Labradorite assists in opening the lower chakras during ritual or magical practices, while Spectrolite works with one's ""Rainbow Body"" to enhance awareness of the higher realms. [Simmons, 226]

Meditate with Golden Labradorite to open channels to the higher realms of archangels. Spiral through and above your hair to mend tears in your aura. [Eason, 102]

Meditating with Spectrolite raises consciousness and facilitates multi- and inter-dimensional journeying. Holding profound esoteric wisdom, it takes you into other lives and prepares the body and soul for ascension. [Hall II, 326]

Meditating with Labradorite allows one to recognize humanity as ""being of light,"" transcending limitations of the past and thoughts of the future, and embracing the infinite possibilities of the moment. It allows one to ""be"" and rest assured the light is always there, surrounding and pure. [Melody, 368]

The Divinatory meaning of Labradorite: You may have to temporarily make the best of a less-than-ideal situation, but soon will be able to do things your way. [Eason, 163]

Feng Shui
Labradorite utilizes Water energy, the energy of stillness, quiet strength, and purification. It embodies potentialities unrealized. It is yielding, formless, yet powerful. The Water element brings power of regeneration and rebirth. It is the energy of the circle of life. Use blue crystals to enhance any space that you use for repose, calm reflection, or prayer. Water energy is traditionally associated with the North area of a home or room. It is associated with the Career and Life Path area, its flowing energy assuring a balance of energy as your life unfolds and flows.

Legend and Lore
In ancient lore, Labradorite was considered to be a talismanic gem of winter, and in Oriental culture was known as a ""phenomenal gem"" to be worn on Saturdays. Phenomenal gems exhibited a moving line, star, or changes on the surface as the light varied, and was considered to bring good fortune to the wearer. [Kunz, 326, 333-334]
Native Inuit tribes of North America claim the first Labradorite fell from the Aurora Borealis from the fire of their ancestors. Another legend describes a brave Inuit warrior who struck Labradorite with his spear and created the Northern Lights

These crystals are particularly effective in stabilizing the emotional body and bringing erratic emotions under calm control. Being water soluble Selenite will eventually dissolve if left in liquid. This important characteristic also endows Selenite with the power to melt away exaggerated emotions with the stabilizing light force of true feeling.

Selenite is also thought to have the ability to clear etheric blockages so one can gain knowledge on how to move forward toward a cure. Selenite can be used as a scanning device for those of us who are not visually orientated to get an overall view of a person's light system to see the thought forms in their energy body. You can direct the energy towards your client or yourself by physically pointing the Selenite towards your client and mentally aligning with its vibration to examine the thought forms that are stored within each energy body.

Selenite is named for Selene, Greek goddess of the Moon because of its moon-like glow. Exchanged between lovers, it will bring about reconciliation.

"10 Celtic Triquetra Pendants Tibetan Silver 28mm x 24mm Wicca Wiccan Witchcraft Witch Magick Metaphysical  Ceremonial Ritual Spell Pagan","28mm x 24mm Beautiful silver Celtic Triquetra pendant.

This listing is for ten pendants.  If you'd like a listing for more, or less, just convo me and I will put up a listing for you. I also have a listing for a single pendant for $2 plus shipping.  I have other styles and sizes of triquetras lsited as well.  See my other listings for pentacles and jewelry findings.


The triquetra is a religious symbol that is almost as well known as a pentagram. It is Latin for “three cornered” and is composed of there interlocking vesica piscis shapes.

 Still widely used in Ireland, it has Celtic origins. It symbolizes love,honor,and protection. It is also known as a Trinity knot and some can be very elaborate or complex while some are simple and unadorned.

The triquetra symbolizes the power of three, which is frequently seen as a divine number. This symbol that is formed from the intersection of three circles can sometimes have a fourth circle woven through it. In this case, the fourth circle makes the significance of the symbolism stronger.  It can connect the mind, body and soul and it represents the way the three individuals are part of one whole. The circle shows spiritual unity with the divine.

Some Christians use the triquetra to symbolize the father, son and holy spirit but this symbol pre dates Christianity, just like the cross, and has a myriad of meanings. It also shows magical, protective traits since it is one of those that can be drawn in one sweep of your pen without taking it off the paper, which adds a lot more power.

There are lots of meanings associated with the triquetra, some of them are:

The three sisters of The Morrighan
life,death and rebirth
Earth, sky and sea
Physical, mental and spiritual
Mother, father and child
Power, love and intellect
Creation, preservation and destruction
Thought, Feeling and emotion
Other world, mortal world and celestial world
Past, present and future
The three bridgits ( art, healing and metalsmithing )

"Tumbled Free Form Shungite Healing Grounding Pain Relief The Stone of Life High Vibration Russia Ascension Rare Powerful Antibacterial","listing is for 1 piece.

SHUNGITE

“The Stone of Life”

High Vibration Crystal

Shungite is helpful to adjust to the new frequencies presented to the earth sphere, as many begin their ascension into the higher realms of existence.

Shugnite is a very rare, yet powerful stone that is said to be almost 2 billion years old. It is best known for its ancient metaphysical healing properties, along with its antibacterial properties. The mineral of this stone is hailed as containing a healing power incomparable to any other. The energy of Shugnite is very mystical. It has the ability to purify, charge, protect, stabilize, heal and promote growth in all living organisms. It also has the ability to clean water from almost of all organic compounds (including pesticides), metals, bacteria and harmful microorganisms.

Shungite will often come across as a stern and disciplined teacher, ready to impart its sacred wisdom with those who are committed to a higher path of evolving. As its frequency can and will align to those who begin to embrace and “wear” a vibratory signature that meets the future with love and light. One has a responsibility when working with the energies of Shungite, as its source is not to be taken lightly or by the faint of heart. The “ancient of ways” seems to echo through from the Shungite gemstone; Older Souls will be able to “hear” this inner language coming through.

Shugnite is a protector, a guardian and a body-guard. It grounds and protects one from all types of negativity. As a protective shield, it embraces the individual in its coat of black permitting only positive rays to come through to the individual. It works on the physical, emotional, mental and spiritual bodies “attacking” the seeds of destruction and decay. It is very pragmatic and fills one with this energy as well. It is a stone full of potential and possibilities, as it can and will propel one along the direction of his/her path, keeping one focused, grounded and centered at all time

Place Shugnite in water to purify and charge the water with cleansing energy. Shungite water has an antihistamine effect, as it helps cure burns, cuts, callosities, arthritis, osteoarthritis and varicose veins. Simple mouthwash with Shungite water will cure sore throat, stomach aches, colds and tonsillitis.

**It is recommended to place Shugnite stones in the sun every 6 months.**

This set was created with a myriad of vintage silver tone findings. A very heavy chain, iridescent carnival glass faceted beads, a large key focal, iridescent clear glass faceted beads, faery bells and adorable little key rings, (the only new component on this set other than the headpins and jump rings), with 3 skeleton keys on this. It took me 15 years of collecting to amass the findings for this set and many hours to create it.

Sterling silver ear wires.

Something old, something new, something borrowed and something blue. This set covers 3 out of the 4. Now, you just need to borrow a trinket to complete this.

This is a statement piece that you can bring out every year to wear on your anniversary and relive the wonderful memories of your special day!

"Energy Amplification Manifestation Choker Quartz and Copper on Memory Wire  Metaphysical Intentions Manifest Crystal Grids Stone Grids Reiki","This is a quartz and copper energy amplification and manifestation necklace from my personal collection, made by me. 

I debated quite a bit of whether or not to even list it for sale, as you should be very good at controlling your thoughts and emotions, as well as very good at programming your intention into stones and crystals to even consider purchasing this piece. If you are, it can be a wonderful tool for you. If not, it can amplify any thoughts/feelings/situations of you yourself, others around you, and the environment around you.

This isn't a piece to put on display, it should be wrapped in a soft cloth and tucked away when you are not using it, to lessen the likelihood of it picking up stray energies.

It will be 4C'd before it is sent out to you, but you need to do the same when you get it to clear anything it may have picked up along the way. You should 4C yourself, your space and then the necklace each time before you work with it or wear it, very important!

Okay, got the warning out of the way, now on to how it works, lol!

Wear it when you are meditating on your intention, making sure to focus on how it would feel to have what you are choosing to manifest, NOT the lack of what you want. You can do this for material objects, situations or things within yourself like confidence etc.. Make sure you can clearly visualize what you want and how it feels.

The quartz chip beads pick up your intention, the copper channels it to the sphere, which stores it until it is full, then pours it out into the water clear generator quartz point, which directs your intention out into the universe.

This is also excellent for wearing when activating grids! If you have a charged and activated grid and you would like to charge the necklace with that intention, simply keep it in that grid when not wearing it after 4Cing you, the environment and it, providing your grid is in a place where it isn't going to pick up stray energies. 

This one also loves to be charged in the moonlight. Do not put it or any stone out in the sun. Contrary to popular belief, sunlight does not charge, it is a harsh cleanser, and there is a very fine line between cleansing a stone in the sun and causing it to go dormant. It is possible to do so much damage to a stone this way that it will be energetically dead, and can take hundreds to thousands of years of being back in the Earth to revitalize it. Please don't do that to your stones and crystals.

NUUMITE
First off, I’d like to start with a very strong warning. If you are not in conscious control of your thoughts, (focusing on what you want, not what you don’t want), this isn’t the stone for you. If you make negative statements and thoughts, (I don’t want to be poor, sick, tired etc.), this isn’t the stone for you. If you are a complainer, this is not the stone for you.
Nuumite is an extremely potent manifestation stone. It will manifest what you are focusing on. I don’t mean just what you are focusing on when you are trying to manifest something, I mean all the time, if it is near you. If you do not regularly practice clearing yourself and your environment, or have other negative people in the environment where this stone will be, this isn’t the stone for you. This is not a stone to be taken lightly. It has a very ancient, powerful elemental energy with a dark polarity. This is a stone of great power and potential, just make sure you are sure that you will use it wisely.

Nuummite, the Sorcere's Stone, draws from the fiery energies of ancient Earth and combines with the elements of Storm. Black as midnight shadows on moonlit water, this talisman shimmers with mystical gold light, lifting the murky to see what lies beneath. It is a stone of personal magic, increasing the frequency of synchronicities and luck, clairvoyance and intuition, and for those evolved enough to work with its intensity, it allows for journeying deep into the personal psyche, offering a clear vision of one's true Self. It helps to release energies trapped in the subconscious and brings the gift of inner power, healing, and self-mastery. [Simmons, 279][Ahsian, 279][Hall II, 198]

Nuummite is a stone of tremendous grounding, attuned to the elemental forces of Earth that can be drawn upon in times of need. It is an excellent source of energy with a strong electro-magnetic field. It aligns the subtle bodies, strengthens the auric shield, and is fiercely protective against negative energies, manipulations, and environmental pollutants. [Simmons, 279][Hall II, 198-199][Eason, 200][Melody, 435-436]

Nuummite is also referred to as the Magician's Stone. Stones with elemental magic should always be taken seriously and used respectfully with right intent, as harmful intent rebounds upon the user. [Hall II, 199]

With its strong access to wild nature energies, Nuummite counteracts modern urban living that may dull the instincts and bring over-reliance on technology.

Chakras
Nuummite provides a physical and spiritual grounding, via the chakras, to both the Earth and ethereal body. The deep black and gray of this crystal stimulates the Base Chakra, or Root Chakra, located at the base of the spine. It controls the energy for kinesthetic feeling and movement, and is the foundation of physical and spiritual energy for the body. When physically out of balance the symptoms will manifest themselves as lethargy, low levels of activity, low enthusiasm, and a need for constant stimulation. When its spiritual energies are out of balance, you will feel flighty, disconnected from reality, and distant. When the Base Chakra is in balance, the physical body regains its strength and stamina, and the spiritual energy is rekindled in the form of security and sense of one's own power. It often leads to independence and spontaneous leadership.

Meditation 
Nuummite is a powerful meditative tool for self-discovery. It often facilitates journeys into the ancient, pre-human past, directly to the time of creation, and allows the accessing of past or alternate lives in order to learn about one's true self. Nuummite may also be used as a gazing stone, aiding one in moving between altered states of consciousness. [Ahsian, 279-280][Simmons, 279]

Divination
The Divinatory meaning of Nuummite: Listen to your inner self. [Eason, 200]


Goddess Associations
Black crystals honor Manat, the Arabian Goddess of Time, Destiny and Death. She is a powerful sorceress that rules the mysteries of witchcraft, divination, life, and death, but also brings a world filled with magic, wisdom and protection.

Black crystals honor Cybele, the Roman Earth Mother and Goddess of Wild Animals. She was originally Phrygian, the Goddess of Caverns because they are dark and hidden. She embodies the fertile Earth. Her festival is the first on the Roman calendar, the Festival of Joy.

All aspects of The Morrighan.

Nuummite is the Sorcerer’s Stone. It is also a Dispeller Harmonizer talisman. Dispeller crystal lattices act like a radiator with sharp points from which energy can flow easily outward, carrying with it the undesirable elements in our life. They are helpful talismans to relieve the everyday concerns of our physical, mental and spiritual problems. Dispellers are also known as Restorers. They put things right again after they are out of balance.

Harmonizers, called the chain and band silicates, bind together in a long chain, distributing energy in a balanced, long-term way. They encourage efforts aimed at smoothing a path through difficulties, promoting harmonious relationships within a larger group, like family, and a peaceful acceptance of life's inherent situations.

Feng Shui 
Nuummite utilizes Water energy, the energy of stillness, quiet strength, and purification. It embodies potentialities unrealized. It is yielding, formless, yet powerful. The Water element brings power of regeneration and rebirth. It is the energy of the circle of life. Use turquoise crystals to enhance any space that you use for repose, calm reflection, or prayer. Water energy is traditionally associated with the North area of a home or room. It is associated with the Career and Life Path area, its flowing energy assuring a balance of energy as your life unfolds and flows.

Energy: various

Planet: Mercury

Element: various

Deity: Aesculapius

Powers: Strength, Courage, Longevity, Gardening, Love, Healing, Protection

Magickal Uses:
In general, the agate is utilized in spells and magickal rituals involving strength, bravery, longevity and so on.

Worn on the arm or carried while gardening, the agate increases your plants’ fertility and ensures a bountiful crop or healthy flowers.
Moss agate was thought to be the best suited for this.

Charged agates can be ‘planted’ in the garden to promote abundance, and small agates hung on trees increase their yield.

In ancient Rome an agate worn in a ring on the hand or bound to the left arm ensured the favor of the vegetative deities, who would cause the Earth to be fruitful.

A stone often utilized in love spells, agate is also worn to avoid envious thoughts and to remove spite; in other words, to make its wearer amiable and agreeable.

It is also worn as a truth amulet, to ensure that your words are pure, and also to ensure favors from powerful persons.

Agate jewelry is given to children to be worn as protective amulets. Agate is thought to be particularly useful in preventing children from falling and is also worn by adults to avoid stumbling.

An agate held in the mouth relieves thirst. It was once used to reduce fevers by applying it to the forehead. Held in the hand the agate calms and refreshes the body and helps it heal minor health problems.

Agates were popular talismans in the Middle East to ensure the healthy state of the blood. In ancient Britain they were worn to guard against skin diseases. Triangular-shaped agates were used in Syria to avert intestinal problems.

In ceremonial magick, agates were engraved with serpents ormen riding on snakes. Worn as an amulet this magickal jewel prevented snake, scorpion and insect bites and stings.

The agate is sometimes used in protective spells and rituals and was once thought to be a sovereign guard against sorcery, demons and fiendish possession.

In Asia, agates were used much as quartz crystal is today. To ascertain future trends the scryer gazed at the markings on the stone, allowing the deep mind to project its psychic impulses to the conscious mind.

The numerous types of agate-vaguely distinguishable by color or markings-are used in various types of magic. Though any type of agate may be worn for the above uses, these particular stones have traditional energies.

Blue Lace Agate: (Energy: Receptive, Element: Water) Wear or carry for peace and happiness. Place in your hand to de-stress. Lay one on your desk or other work station and gaze at it when in stressful situations. In the horne, a blue lace agate surrounded with flaming, light blue candles calms the psychic atmosphere and reduces household or family quarrels.

Brown or Tawny Agate: (Energy: Projective, Element: Fire) Once worn by warriors for victory in battle, the brown agate is used today for success in any undertaking. It was prized in Italy and Persia as a guard against the evil eye. It’s also a wealth talisman.

Green Agate: (Energy: Receptive, Element: Earth) Worn to improve the health of the eyes. In the past, a woman who drank the water a green agate ring was washed in was magickally guarded against sterility.

Chakras
Labradorite radiates a predominant blue crystal energy that stimulates the Throat Chakra, the voice of the body. It is, in essence, a pressure valve that allows the energy from the other chakras to be expressed. If it is blocked, or out of balance, it can affect the health of the other chakras. When the throat chakra is in balance and open, it allows for the expression of what we think and what we feel. We can communicate our ideas, beliefs, and emotions, bringing our personal truth out into the world. We have an easy flow of energy within the body and spirit. The energy that springs upward from the lower chakras can continue its path enabling free expression and natural release. Darker shades of blue encourage the power of truth, while lighter shades carry the power of flexibility, relaxation, and balance. Labradorite, with its iridescent flashes of color, can be very beneficial in uniting all of the chakras.

Golden Labradorite assists in opening the lower chakras during ritual or magical practices, while Spectrolite works with one's ""Rainbow Body"" to enhance awareness of the higher realms. [Simmons, 226]

Meditate with Golden Labradorite to open channels to the higher realms of archangels. Spiral through and above your hair to mend tears in your aura. [Eason, 102]

Meditating with Spectrolite raises consciousness and facilitates multi- and inter-dimensional journeying. Holding profound esoteric wisdom, it takes you into other lives and prepares the body and soul for ascension. [Hall II, 326]

Meditating with Labradorite allows one to recognize humanity as ""being of light,"" transcending limitations of the past and thoughts of the future, and embracing the infinite possibilities of the moment. It allows one to ""be"" and rest assured the light is always there, surrounding and pure. [Melody, 368]

The Divinatory meaning of Labradorite: You may have to temporarily make the best of a less-than-ideal situation, but soon will be able to do things your way. [Eason, 163]

Feng Shui
Labradorite utilizes Water energy, the energy of stillness, quiet strength, and purification. It embodies potentialities unrealized. It is yielding, formless, yet powerful. The Water element brings power of regeneration and rebirth. It is the energy of the circle of life. Use blue crystals to enhance any space that you use for repose, calm reflection, or prayer. Water energy is traditionally associated with the North area of a home or room. It is associated with the Career and Life Path area, its flowing energy assuring a balance of energy as your life unfolds and flows.

Chakra
Crown
Throat
Third Eye
Amethyst carries a high, sweet energy, particularly stimulating to the Third Eye, Crown and Etheric Chakras. [Ahsian, 29]

The Brow Chakra, also called the Third Eye, is the center of our perception and command. It directs our sight and everyday awareness of the world. Our consciousness is located here, and we relate to ourselves through this chakra. When the Brow Chakra is in balance our thoughts and internal communications within ourselves are healthy and vibrant. We are open to new ideas, dreams, and visions, and can control the flow of energy within all the chakras. The dark blue/purple crystals of indigo are used to treat imbalances of the Brow Chakra. It is a quiet color, one of mystery and wisdom and judgment.

The Crown Chakra is located at the top of the head, and is our gateway to the expanded universe beyond our bodies. It controls how we think, and how we respond to the world around us. It is the fountainhead of our beliefs and the source of our spirituality. It connects us to the higher planes of existence and is the source of universal energy and truth. When the Crown is in balance, our energies are in balance. We know our place in the universe and see things as they are. We are unruffled by setbacks, knowing they are an essential part of life. Imbalances of the Crown Chakra are treated with Light Violet crystals. Their violet rays have the universal life force of magic, dreams, inspiration, and destiny.

The higher vibrational White and Lavender/White crystals are associated with the Higher Crown, Soul Star and Stellar Gateway Chakras. They are attuned to higher, more spiritually enlightened things, and embody true humility. They provide a soul connection and the highest self-illumination, as well as a cosmic doorway to other worlds. [Hall II, 366] They represent personal identification with the Infinite, and oneness with God, peace and wisdom. [Raphell, 164]

Chakras
Labradorite radiates a predominant blue crystal energy that stimulates the Throat Chakra, the voice of the body. It is, in essence, a pressure valve that allows the energy from the other chakras to be expressed. If it is blocked, or out of balance, it can affect the health of the other chakras. When the throat chakra is in balance and open, it allows for the expression of what we think and what we feel. We can communicate our ideas, beliefs, and emotions, bringing our personal truth out into the world. We have an easy flow of energy within the body and spirit. The energy that springs upward from the lower chakras can continue its path enabling free expression and natural release. Darker shades of blue encourage the power of truth, while lighter shades carry the power of flexibility, relaxation, and balance. Labradorite, with its iridescent flashes of color, can be very beneficial in uniting all of the chakras.

Golden Labradorite assists in opening the lower chakras during ritual or magical practices, while Spectrolite works with one's ""Rainbow Body"" to enhance awareness of the higher realms. [Simmons, 226]

Meditate with Golden Labradorite to open channels to the higher realms of archangels. Spiral through and above your hair to mend tears in your aura. [Eason, 102]

Meditating with Spectrolite raises consciousness and facilitates multi- and inter-dimensional journeying. Holding profound esoteric wisdom, it takes you into other lives and prepares the body and soul for ascension. [Hall II, 326]

Meditating with Labradorite allows one to recognize humanity as ""being of light,"" transcending limitations of the past and thoughts of the future, and embracing the infinite possibilities of the moment. It allows one to ""be"" and rest assured the light is always there, surrounding and pure. [Melody, 368]

The Divinatory meaning of Labradorite: You may have to temporarily make the best of a less-than-ideal situation, but soon will be able to do things your way. [Eason, 163]

Feng Shui
Labradorite utilizes Water energy, the energy of stillness, quiet strength, and purification. It embodies potentialities unrealized. It is yielding, formless, yet powerful. The Water element brings power of regeneration and rebirth. It is the energy of the circle of life. Use blue crystals to enhance any space that you use for repose, calm reflection, or prayer. Water energy is traditionally associated with the North area of a home or room. It is associated with the Career and Life Path area, its flowing energy assuring a balance of energy as your life unfolds and flows.

Legend and Lore
In ancient lore, Labradorite was considered to be a talismanic gem of winter, and in Oriental culture was known as a ""phenomenal gem"" to be worn on Saturdays. Phenomenal gems exhibited a moving line, star, or changes on the surface as the light varied, and was considered to bring good fortune to the wearer. [Kunz, 326, 333-334]

These crystals are particularly effective in stabilizing the emotional body and bringing erratic emotions under calm control. Being water soluble Selenite will eventually dissolve if left in liquid. This important characteristic also endows Selenite with the power to melt away exaggerated emotions with the stabilizing light force of true feeling.

Selenite is also thought to have the ability to clear etheric blockages so one can gain knowledge on how to move forward toward a cure. Selenite can be used as a scanning device for those of us who are not visually orientated to get an overall view of a person's light system to see the thought forms in their energy body. You can direct the energy towards your client or yourself by physically pointing the Selenite towards your client and mentally aligning with its vibration to examine the thought forms that are stored within each energy body.

Selenite is named for Selene, Greek goddess of the Moon because of its moon-like glow. Exchanged between lovers, it will bring about reconciliation.

Cleansing Your CHAKRAS

Yes, there a a whole slew of stones that are associated with each chakra, but there are steps to working with your chakras.

First and foremost, you cleanse your chakras, get all of that nasty, icky, dirty, energy out.

If you activate a dirty chakra, you are just activating all of the nasty stuff that is there.

If you energize a dirty chakra, you are just amplifying all of the problems related to that chakra that you are experiencing, please don't do that to yourself.

Energy can not flow correctly within a dirty chakra, nor can it flow correctly between dirty chakras.


Everyone also seems to forget about the importance of your Earth chakra, (this is the chakra that is about grounding, among other things, it connects to your root chakra, but your root chakra is not what grounds you), as well as pumping physical energy into your chakra system, and your high crown chakra, (this is where your divine/cosmic/spiritual energy comes into your chakra system at.


Think of your high crown chakra as your shower head, and your Earth chakra as your shower drain. If the water pressure sucks, your not going to get a very good shower of divine/cosmic/spiritual energy are you?

If your Earth chakra isn't functioning correctly, then all of that nasty gunk in your chakras and auric field isn't being grounded into the Earth to be transmuted into something helpful, but rather backing up into your root chakra, and on up, can you say gross y'all?


If you do nothing else with your chakras, keep them clean, 7-10 minutes a day to cleanse your chakras, that's it, easy.

Simply lay down and place the stones on your chakras, from Earth chakra (2 -3 feet below your feet, stones can be placed at your feet), to high crown, (generally 6 - 18 inches above your head, place the stone in this area when you are laying down,) leave them on for 7-10 minutes, (If they roll off, they're done, don't put them back on), take them off in reverse order and your done, easy.

Just make sure you are properly preparing your stones before you use them. Click here for instructions on how to do that: 
https://www.facebook.com/notes/morrighans-cauldron/energetic-hygiene-the-4-cs/670352319751258


Here are the correct stones to cleanse your chakras:


Earth Chakra: Smoky Quartz


Root Chakra: Red Calcite


Sacral Chakra: Orange Calcite


Solar Plexus Chakra: Honey Calcite (don't use, gold, citrine, lemon etc. calcite, these are activators, not cleansers)


Heart Chakra: Green Calcite AND Rose Quartz (your heart chakra is pink on the inside, spiritual, and green on the outside, physical, and both parts need to be addressed.)


Throat Chakra: Blue Calcite


Third Eye Chakra: Predominantly purple and green fluorite. (The best is from Brazil, Fluorite from China is a bit lazy, and Fluorite from Russia is very, very strong, bossy and is best suited to high magik practices).


Crown Chakra: Clear Calcite (not optical calcite, optical calcite should NEVER be placed on a chakra within your physical body and not crystal calcite, which is an activator).


High Crown Chakra: Quartz or Selenite

Get into the habit of practicing proper energetic hygiene on your chakras and auric field, before even thinking about activating, energizing, balancing and fine tuning your chakras. 

Do not use the stones you use to cleanse your chakras and auric field for other purposes, or share them with other people, it would be like sharing a toothbrush, yuck!

CALCITE




Calcite was used in Ancient Egypt for ritual bowls to help pass the gentle healing powers of the stone. It was believed to amplify the power of prayer. Stalactites that have been formed by this stone have led to many legends that speak of animals and people that have been turned into the stone. The most famous is the Witch of Wookey Holes Caves in Somerset England.

Calcite is a powerful cleanser that removes negative energy from environment. It also can heighten your personal energy as it helps to remove the stagnant energy present. If you are working in a hostile environment, Calcite helps to make you resistant to the negative vibes of others. It is a very spiritual stone that is linked to the higher consciousness and facilitates the opening of higher awareness and psychic abilities.

Calcite can also help with out of body experiences or Astral Travel. It is a stone of memory that helps you to stimulate insight, increate memory retention and retaining information. Calcite helps you to find hope or motivation during times of need. It brings serenity and harmony into life. It can also help you to break out of patterns of action that make you repeat the same mistake over and over again.

Combine this with rose quartz to cleanse the heart chakra.

Green Calcite helps you to dissolve rigid beliefs and old ""programming"" in order to restore balance to your mind. It helps you to let go of what is ""familiar"" but no longer serves your inner self. It helps you get away from a stagnant situation into a more positive one.",3.75,USD,19,"Everything_Else,Metaphysical,Crystal,Wicca,Witchcraft,Witch,stone_whisperer,sacred,Wiccan,magick,magik,new_age,stone_magik,chakra,auric_field,sacred_stones","auric field,energetic hygiene,energy hygiene,personal hygiene,chakra cleansing with stones,physical aspect of heart chakra,emotions,relationships,love,karmic ties,karmic bonds,sould mate,twin flame",https://img0.etsystatic.com/052/0/7575218/il_fullxfull.702119950_s564.jpg,,,,

Cleansing Your CHAKRAS

Yes, there a a whole slew of stones that are associated with each chakra, but there are steps to working with your chakras.

First and foremost, you cleanse your chakras, get all of that nasty, icky, dirty, energy out.

If you activate a dirty chakra, you are just activating all of the nasty stuff that is there.

If you energize a dirty chakra, you are just amplifying all of the problems related to that chakra that you are experiencing, please don't do that to yourself.

Energy can not flow correctly within a dirty chakra, nor can it flow correctly between dirty chakras.


Everyone also seems to forget about the importance of your Earth chakra, (this is the chakra that is about grounding, among other things, it connects to your root chakra, but your root chakra is not what grounds you), as well as pumping physical energy into your chakra system, and your high crown chakra, (this is where your divine/cosmic/spiritual energy comes into your chakra system at.


Think of your high crown chakra as your shower head, and your Earth chakra as your shower drain. If the water pressure sucks, your not going to get a very good shower of divine/cosmic/spiritual energy are you?

If your Earth chakra isn't functioning correctly, then all of that nasty gunk in your chakras and auric field isn't being grounded into the Earth to be transmuted into something helpful, but rather backing up into your root chakra, and on up, can you say gross y'all?


If you do nothing else with your chakras, keep them clean, 7-10 minutes a day to cleanse your chakras, that's it, easy.

Simply lay down and place the stones on your chakras, from Earth chakra (2 -3 feet below your feet, stones can be placed at your feet), to high crown, (generally 6 - 18 inches above your head, place the stone in this area when you are laying down,) leave them on for 7-10 minutes, (If they roll off, they're done, don't put them back on), take them off in reverse order and your done, easy.

Selenite has the power to cleanse and clear other crystals and negative energies. You will never need to cleanse or recharge your Selenite crystal. Selenite can increase your psychic or telepathic abilities, place a piece of Selenite on your Third Eye Chakra.

These crystals are particularly effective in stabilizing the emotional body and bringing erratic emotions under calm control. Being water soluble Selenite will eventually dissolve if left in liquid. This important characteristic also endows Selenite with the power to melt away exaggerated emotions with the stabilizing light force of true feeling.

Selenite is also thought to have the ability to clear etheric blockages so one can gain knowledge on how to move forward toward a cure. Selenite can be used as a scanning device for those of us who are not visually orientated to get an overall view of a person's light system to see the thought forms in their energy body. You can direct the energy towards your client or yourself by physically pointing the Selenite towards your client and mentally aligning with its vibration to examine the thought forms that are stored within each energy body.

Selenite is named for Selene, Greek goddess of the Moon because of its moon-like glow. Exchanged between lovers, it will bring about reconciliation.

Includes:
1 8 - 10 inch raw selenite wand
1 bag of organic sage
1 smudge shell
1 set of 7 metal tingshas
1 black satin bag for your tingshas
Instructions for use.

This kit can be used to cleanse, clear, charge and correct the vibrational frequency of your auric field, your stones and crystals, objects and your space, whether it be a room, or your entire property.

CLEANSING, CLEARING, CHARGING AND CORRECTING THE VIBRATIONAL FREQUENCIES OF YOUR GEMSTONES AND CRYSTALS

Sometimes a stone or crystal you are strongly drawn to doesn't feel good, or a stone that felt good previously doesn't feel good now. The stone or crystal may need to be cleansed, cleared, charged and corrected. Cleansing is necessary before using any stone. You also need to clear any old programming in your stone. Charging tremendously increases the energy of your stones and crystals. Correcting the vibrational frequency of your stones brings their energy back into proper alignment, kind of like adjusting the timing belt on a car. I use the 3 steps below before I use any crystal or stone for any purpose.

You can use the same method listed below for any object as well.
1. SMUDGING- Use organic white sage. Only organic, otherwise, you are just adding all of the low vibrational negative energy of the toxic chemicals used on the sage into your environment and your crystals. Simply hold the stone or crystal in the smoke for 30-60 seconds, you will feel when it’s done. If you can't burn sage, an organic white sage spray will work. This is the first part of cleansing your stones.

2. SELENITE- Place your stones or crystals with or on selenite. 24 hours the first time you clear and charge them, or if they've been exposed to particularly nasty energies. After that, a few minutes will do the trick just fine. Selenite is the second part of cleansing your stones, it also clears your stones as well as charges them. I like to keep selenite with my stones when not in use.

3. TINGSHAS- Properly made 7 metal tingshas will bring the vibrational frequency of your stones and crystals back to allignment, making it much harder for negative energies to attach themselves to your crystal or stone, allowing them to work at optimum levels. The tingshas must be made of the correct ratio of the 7 metals that correspond to the 7 major chakras within the human body, otherwise, they can have quite the opposite effect, which will invite negative energies, rather than repel them. Simply ring the tingshas over the stones 3 times, allowing them to settle between each ring, you will hear the difference each time you ring them.

Cleansing Your Auric Field

Cleansing your auric field is very simple, organic white sage to cleanse, a raw selenite wand of at least 8 inches to comb out any energetic debris left over from smudging and any kinks or knots of energy in your auric field, a good set of 7 metal tingshas to raise the vibrational frequency of your auric field too high for low level negative energy to hang out in it, charging it with positive energy, and 5 minutes of your time a day,

1. SMUDGING. Light one sage leaf, (if you have a sage bundle, you can simply remove a leaf. You don't want to light the entire bundle, then have to put it out. They can re-ignite, and it's much better for the energy flow to let it burn out naturally.), in your smudging shell or dish, make sure it is smoking well, and then hold it, (carefully), at the height of your high crown chakra, (this is usually 4-6 inches above the top of your head), Hold it there for a few seconds, then work down around your body, in a spiral, passing the shell/dish from hand to hand as necessary, letting the smoke waft through your auric field. (A healthy auric field extends about 2 1/2 to 3 feet out from your body. Hold your hands straight out to your sides, this is about how far your auric field should extend.) When you've reached the floor, sit the dish/shell between your feet, allow the smoke a few seconds to waft up, then hold each foot a safe distance above your sage to cleanse the soles of your feet, one at a time of course, holding on to something for balance if necessary. After a few times, you'll have this done in less than a minute.

2. SELENITE. Hold your raw selenite wand in your hand by one end, hold it at the level of your high crown chakra and comb downward in front of your face, all the way from the floor, just like you were combing your hair. Touch the tip of your selenite wand to the floor/ground. Repeat this all the way around your body, slightly over lapping strokes, until you've gone all the way around your body. (You will need to pass it from one hand to the other when going down your back.) When you've finished this, pass it back and forth under each foot, touching the floor after each foot, now you're done. 

3. TINGSHAS. Hold the tingshas at high crown chakra height, and strike the edge of one with the edge of the other, bringing them down towards your crown chakra. After they settle, do this a second and third time. Notice the change in tone after each time.

The more you do this, the faster and easier it will get. It takes me less than 2 minutes, that's it. You should do this at least once a day. I like to do it first thing in the morning, and before I go to bed. You can also do this after a stressful situation/event, or any time you feel the need.

Cleansing, Clearing, Charging and Correcting the Vibrational Frequency of Your SPACE

You can do this for any space, your room, your house, your car, your entire property.
If you're doing this for your car, do it on the outside, as well as the inside preferably.
Choose a corner of your space to start with, and always start with the same corner. Always physically clean the space first, and clear out any clutter. Open draws and doors. If your space is highly negativly charged, you may need to repeat this nightly for a week, (around sundown is best), then go to once a week.

1. SMUDGING. Light your organic white sage in your smudging shell/bowl, and when it is smoking well, start at your chosen corner, walk around the room, stopping at each corner for a few seconds. Circle the space 3 times. (If you are doing more than one room, do this in each space, (don't forget the closets), allowing the smoke to waft into any cabinets etc. along the way.

2. SELENITE. Follow the same steps as you did above with your sage, touching the floor with the tip of your selenite when you finish your space. (If you are going to grid your space with selenite, now's the time. Simply place selenite in each corner. There are other stones you can place with the selenite, depending on what energy(s) you'd like to attract or repel. Raw black tourmaline is one I always recommend to add to your selenite. The possibilities are way to long to list here, just ask me if you need help selecting stones.

3. TINGSHAS. Follow the same steps above, ringing your tingshas in each corner.

Ruby General Gemstone Details
ˈrü-bē
Stone of Nobility
Ruby has always enjoyed a very regal position in legend, myth and lore; for thousands and thousands of years it has been a favored talisman for royalty worldwide.
It is told that Catherine of Aragon wore an infamous ruby, that legend tells us turned dark and dull the day before Henry VII announced he was divorcing her.
Ruby has long been considered to be one of the more powerful gifts to honor Buddha and Krishna. The Hindu people have believed that Ruby’s red glow came from an internal flame that no human could possibly extinguish; thus making it quite spirtual.
METAPHYSICAL:
Energy: Projective
Element: Fire
Planet: Mars
Deities: Buddha, Krishna (not Hare Krishnas)
Powers: Power, Wealth, Projection, Joy
Candle Color: Deep Red 
Zodiac Stone of: Leo, Scorpio, Cancer & Sagittarius

Birthstone: Modern Birthstone for July, Traditional & Mystical Birthstone for July, Ayurvedic Birthstone for July and December and Ancient Birthstone for December. Anniversary Stone for the 15th, 40th and 80th years.
Talisman Stone for the sign of Pisces.
Dreaming of Ruby may be a signal that money or wealth are coming one’s way.
Ruby is a powerful stone to shield against negative energy, psychic attack, and energy vampirism, especially of the heart energy.
Working with Ruby one may feel that all sense of limitation has been removed, strengthening courage, joy, leadership qualities and selfless work in all spiritual endeavors.
The Ruby is able to create a strong sense and means of power within oneself, and this needs to be handled in a responsible manner or it may turn to conceit, anger and possessive thoughts. It helps to guard against accumulating resentment when you are required to care for others.
Ruled by the planet Mars, Ruby is worn during rituals to increase inherent energies that may be available; when one is feeling drained or depleted the stone may be placed beside a red candle to lend energy.
Rubies should be cleansed/discharged and recharged simultaneously in sea salt; avoiding exposure to sunlight if at all possible during this time.
The Ruby is said to bring fire into one’s life, offering encouragement to follow one’s bliss. It will light the darkness of ones life with a spark of energy, conquering darkness on all levels and planes. Ruby will promote creativity and will grant expansive awareness and manifestation.
This stone has been used to stabilize one’s economic status; told that for as long as one carries or retains a piece of Ruby wealth will never depart.
When one seems unable to concentrate seeming to flit from one idea to another, Ruby will help pull focus and bring clarity as well as wisdom; assisting one choose the most productive path and sustain motivation. One will be able to more easily resist self-destructive patterns that may have been harmful in one’s past.
HEALING:
The most ancient records contain information stating that Rubies were used to detoxify the blood, prevent starvation and protection from the plague.
The Ruby is still known to be used to remove toxins from the blood and the entire body. Treats fevers as well as infectious disease. It is said to be extremely beneficial for the heart and circulatory system as it increases blood flow, stimulating the adrenals, kidneys, spleen and reproductive organs.
Told to help one overcome exhaustion and lethargy replacing them with potency and vigor

Ruby is a Corundums which are aluminum oxide silicates that gain their color by chromium, iron and/or titanium. Gemologists consider a ‘perfect’ corundum to be crystal clear. It is chromium that colors stones pinkish red to plum and those are classified as Ruby; all other colors are often classified as Sapphires. There is a long standing argument within the gem world as to where the ‘cut off’ in color is to be designated.

Fluorite is known for being a mental body stone, but Yttrium is very different in the fact that it is attached to the physical world. While this may seem an unusual property for a mentally orientated mineral, it does serve an important function.

Many people are too mentally oriented, they are thinkers, philosophers and dreamers who lack the discipline or grounded-ness to bring their ideas into reality. Yttrium Fluorite assists in grounding the ideas of these thinkers by manifesting those plans–making things happen.

Another way the energies of this stone maybe utilized is by bringing down mental concepts to a level more readily understood by the average person. Minerals such as Selenite give us access into higher wisdom, Calcite can bridge the gap between that reality and our own, but a mineral such as Yttrium Fluorite will bring that information down through the physical plane to a level more easily understood.",5,USD,50,"Everything_Else,Metaphysical,Crystal,stone,crystal,rock,gem,gemstone,new_age,magick,magik,Wicca,Witchcraft,Witch,stone_whisperer,sacred","rainbow fluorite,blue fluorite,clear fluorite,purple fluorite,green fluorite,clarity,organization,cleanse third eye brow chakra,ground ideas into reality,brings order to chaos,healing,spiritual balance,mystic visions",https://img1.etsystatic.com/056/0/7575218/il_fullxfull.701804855_fe4f.jpg,,,,

Third Eye
Amethyst carries a high, sweet energy, particularly stimulating to the Third Eye, Crown and Etheric Chakras. [Ahsian, 29]

The Brow Chakra, also called the Third Eye, is the center of our perception and command. It directs our sight and everyday awareness of the world. Our consciousness is located here, and we relate to ourselves through this chakra. When the Brow Chakra is in balance our thoughts and internal communications within ourselves are healthy and vibrant. We are open to new ideas, dreams, and visions, and can control the flow of energy within all the chakras. The dark blue/purple crystals of indigo are used to treat imbalances of the Brow Chakra. It is a quiet color, one of mystery and wisdom and judgment.

The Crown Chakra is located at the top of the head, and is our gateway to the expanded universe beyond our bodies. It controls how we think, and how we respond to the world around us. It is the fountainhead of our beliefs and the source of our spirituality. It connects us to the higher planes of existence and is the source of universal energy and truth. When the Crown is in balance, our energies are in balance. We know our place in the universe and see things as they are. We are unruffled by setbacks, knowing they are an essential part of life. Imbalances of the Crown Chakra are treated with Light Violet crystals. Their violet rays have the universal life force of magic, dreams, inspiration, and destiny. 

The higher vibrational White and Lavender/White crystals are associated with the Higher Crown, Soul Star and Stellar Gateway Chakras. They are attuned to higher, more spiritually enlightened things, and embody true humility. They provide a soul connection and the highest self-illumination, as well as a cosmic doorway to other worlds. [Hall II, 366] They represent personal identification with the Infinite, and oneness with God, peace and wisdom.

Agate

Folk Names: Red Agate, Blood Agate

Energy: various

Planet: Mercury

Element: various

Deity: Aesculapius

Powers: Strength, Courage, Longevity, Gardening, Love, Healing, Protection

Magickal Uses:
In general, the agate is utilized in spells and magickal rituals involving strength, bravery, longevity and so on.

Worn on the arm or carried while gardening, the agate increases your plants’ fertility and ensures a bountiful crop or healthy flowers.
Moss agate was thought to be the best suited for this.

Charged agates can be ‘planted’ in the garden to promote abundance, and small agates hung on trees increase their yield.

In ancient Rome an agate worn in a ring on the hand or bound to the left arm ensured the favor of the vegetative deities, who would cause the Earth to be fruitful.

A stone often utilized in love spells, agate is also worn to avoid envious thoughts and to remove spite; in other words, to make its wearer amiable and agreeable.

It is also worn as a truth amulet, to ensure that your words are pure, and also to ensure favors from powerful persons.

Agate jewelry is given to children to be worn as protective amulets. Agate is thought to be particularly useful in preventing children from falling and is also worn by adults to avoid stumbling.

An agate held in the mouth relieves thirst. It was once used to reduce fevers by applying it to the forehead. Held in the hand the agate calms and refreshes the body and helps it heal minor health problems.

Agates were popular talismans in the Middle East to ensure the healthy state of the blood. In ancient Britain they were worn to guard against skin diseases. Triangular-shaped agates were used in Syria to avert intestinal problems.

In ceremonial magick, agates were engraved with serpents ormen riding on snakes. Worn as an amulet this magickal jewel prevented snake, scorpion and insect bites and stings.

The agate is sometimes used in protective spells and rituals and was once thought to be a sovereign guard against sorcery, demons and fiendish possession.

In Asia, agates were used much as quartz crystal is today. To ascertain future trends the scryer gazed at the markings on the stone, allowing the deep mind to project its psychic impulses to the conscious mind.

The numerous types of agate-vaguely distinguishable by color or markings-are used in various types of magic. Though any type of agate may be worn for the above uses, these particular stones have traditional energies.

Here’s a list of some of the major ones and their magickal attributions:

Banded Agate: (Energy: Projective, Element: Fire) Protection. Restores bodily energy and eases stressful situations.

Black Agate: (Energy: Projective, Element: Fire) Another protective stone. Wear for courage and successful competitions.

Black and White Agate: (Energy: Receptive, Element: Earth) Worn as an amulet, this stone guards against physical dangers.

Blue Lace Agate: (Energy: Receptive, Element: Water) Wear or carry for peace and happiness. Place in your hand to de-stress. Lay one on your desk or other work station and gaze at it when in stressful situations. In the horne, a blue lace agate surrounded with flaming, light blue candles calms the psychic atmosphere and reduces household or family quarrels.

Brown or Tawny Agate: (Energy: Projective, Element: Fire) Once worn by warriors for victory in battle, the brown agate is used today for success in any undertaking. It was prized in Italy and Persia as a guard against the evil eye. It’s also a wealth talisman.

Green Agate: (Energy: Receptive, Element: Earth) Worn to improve the health of the eyes. In the past, a woman who drank the water a green agate ring was washed in was magickally guarded against sterility.

Moss Agate: (Energy: Receptive, Element: Earth) Due to its curious markings, which suggest moss or trees, the moss agate is the especial gardener’s talisman. It is worn to relieve a stiff neck, to lend energy to the depleted, and for healing purposes. It is also used in spells involving riches, happiness and long life. Wear this stone to make new friends and to discover “treasure.”

Red Agate: (Energy: Projective, Element: Fire) Also known as “Blood Agate,” this stone was worn in ancient Rome to guard against insect bites, to heal the blood, and to promote calm and peace.

Hematite is a metallic gray iron oxide mineral, and the same stone of a differing variety as specularite.
Ancient Egyptians used it to stanch blood and promote the formation of blood cells. In the Middle Ages is was known as the ""blood stone"" due to the fact that the water used to polish it would turn red during the process, as if the stone were bleeding. Native American folklore states that war paint made from hematite will make one invincible in battle. People in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries wore hematite jewelry during mourning.

Scientists of the Mars Exploration Rover Project believe that deposits of hematite on Mars may help prove whether large amounts of liquid water ever flowed on Mars' surface. They say that where water was, life may have had a chance to thrive as well.

Hematite is said to protect the wearer's vita energy and guarantee survival. Amulets of hematite have been found in nearly every pharaoh's tomb as a support in the afterlife.

Hematite, besides it's association with the blood, has also been known to be called the stone for the mind. It brings with it grounding and calming which in turn creates mental organization and focus. It will assist in original thinking, logical thinking, and mathematics.

Hematite decreases negativity and can help balance the mind - body - spirit connection, it draws negative energy away from you into itself. It acts well as a stabilizing force.

It is both grounding and healing, yet allows great room for spiritual growth, manifestations, and divination. It is considered the ""Stone of the Mind"".

Hematite is a stone of magicians and exorcists. It enhances mental activity, balances YIN/YANG energies and emotions, dissolves negativity. The force and the power of Mars is concealed in this stone that allows the wearer to influence other people.

PHYSICAL
Hematite is used for staunching blood as well as to stabilize the circulation of blood and combat venous hyperemia and embolism. It is helpful in treating: Leg cramps. Blood disorders, anemia. Kidney disorders, nervous disorders, insomnia, anxiety, spinal alignment, bone restructuring. Hematite stimulates iron absorption in the small intestine, which in turn improves oxygen supply to the body, normalization of blood pressure and body weight. It is also beneficial for spleen functioning, increases resistibility to stresses, boosts energy, optimistic mood, spiritual stability and will-power.

Cleansing Your CHAKRAS

Yes, there a a whole slew of stones that are associated with each chakra, but there are steps to working with your chakras.

First and foremost, you cleanse your chakras, get all of that nasty, icky, dirty, energy out.

If you activate a dirty chakra, you are just activating all of the nasty stuff that is there.

If you energize a dirty chakra, you are just amplifying all of the problems related to that chakra that you are experiencing, please don't do that to yourself.

Energy can not flow correctly within a dirty chakra, nor can it flow correctly between dirty chakras.


Everyone also seems to forget about the importance of your Earth chakra, (this is the chakra that is about grounding, among other things, it connects to your root chakra, but your root chakra is not what grounds you), as well as pumping physical energy into your chakra system, and your high crown chakra, (this is where your divine/cosmic/spiritual energy comes into your chakra system at.


Think of your high crown chakra as your shower head, and your Earth chakra as your shower drain. If the water pressure sucks, your not going to get a very good shower of divine/cosmic/spiritual energy are you?

If your Earth chakra isn't functioning correctly, then all of that nasty gunk in your chakras and auric field isn't being grounded into the Earth to be transmuted into something helpful, but rather backing up into your root chakra, and on up, can you say gross y'all?


If you do nothing else with your chakras, keep them clean, 7-10 minutes a day to cleanse your chakras, that's it, easy.

Simply lay down and place the stones on your chakras, from Earth chakra (2 -3 feet below your feet, stones can be placed at your feet), to high crown, (generally 6 - 18 inches above your head, place the stone in this area when you are laying down,) leave them on for 7-10 minutes, (If they roll off, they're done, don't put them back on), take them off in reverse order and your done, easy.

Just make sure you are properly preparing your stones before you use them. Click here for instructions on how to do that: 
https://www.facebook.com/notes/morrighans-cauldron/energetic-hygiene-the-4-cs/670352319751258


Here are the correct stones to cleanse your chakras:


Earth Chakra: Smoky Quartz


Root Chakra: Red Calcite


Sacral Chakra: Orange Calcite


Solar Plexus Chakra: Honey Calcite (don't use, gold, citrine, lemon etc. calcite, these are activators, not cleansers)


Heart Chakra: Green Calcite AND Rose Quartz (your heart chakra is pink on the inside, spiritual, and green on the outside, physical, and both parts need to be addressed.)


Throat Chakra: Blue Calcite


Third Eye Chakra: Predominantly purple and green fluorite. (The best is from Brazil, Fluorite from China is a bit lazy, and Fluorite from Russia is very, very strong, bossy and is best suited to high magik practices).


Crown Chakra: Clear Calcite (not optical calcite, optical calcite should NEVER be placed on a chakra within your physical body and not crystal calcite, which is an activator).


High Crown Chakra: Quartz or Selenite

Get into the habit of practicing proper energetic hygiene on your chakras and auric field, before even thinking about activating, energizing, balancing and fine tuning your chakras. 

Do not use the stones you use to cleanse your chakras and auric field for other purposes, or share them with other people, it would be like sharing a toothbrush, yuck!

RED CALCITE
Red calcite is used to cleanse the root chakra, and aids in detoxifying the chakra system through the root chakra. Chakras should always be cleansed before doing any other work with them, and cleansed on a regular basis.
Stone of Humanity
Calcite is common worldwide, it is the principal component in limestone, marbles, as well as stalactites and stalagmites. Possibly found as a large transparent, colorless, complex crystals, or prismatic crystals intergrown with other different minerals.
Due to it’s soft presentation, it is generally not faceted except for collectors, generally crafted into stones or en cabochon.

SHUNGITE

“The Stone of Life”

High Vibration Crystal

Shungite is helpful to adjust to the new frequencies presented to the earth sphere, as many begin their ascension into the higher realms of existence.

Shugnite is a very rare, yet powerful stone that is said to be almost 2 billion years old. It is best known for its ancient metaphysical healing properties, along with its antibacterial properties. The mineral of this stone is hailed as containing a healing power incomparable to any other. The energy of Shugnite is very mystical. It has the ability to purify, charge, protect, stabilize, heal and promote growth in all living organisms. It also has the ability to clean water from almost of all organic compounds (including pesticides), metals, bacteria and harmful microorganisms.

Shungite will often come across as a stern and disciplined teacher, ready to impart its sacred wisdom with those who are committed to a higher path of evolving. As its frequency can and will align to those who begin to embrace and “wear” a vibratory signature that meets the future with love and light. One has a responsibility when working with the energies of Shungite, as its source is not to be taken lightly or by the faint of heart. The “ancient of ways” seems to echo through from the Shungite gemstone; Older Souls will be able to “hear” this inner language coming through.

Shugnite is a protector, a guardian and a body-guard. It grounds and protects one from all types of negativity. As a protective shield, it embraces the individual in its coat of black permitting only positive rays to come through to the individual. It works on the physical, emotional, mental and spiritual bodies “attacking” the seeds of destruction and decay. It is very pragmatic and fills one with this energy as well. It is a stone full of potential and possibilities, as it can and will propel one along the direction of his/her path, keeping one focused, grounded and centered at all time

Place Shugnite in water to purify and charge the water with cleansing energy. Shungite water has an antihistamine effect, as it helps cure burns, cuts, callosities, arthritis, osteoarthritis and varicose veins. Simple mouthwash with Shungite water will cure sore throat, stomach aches, colds and tonsillitis.

**It is recommended to place Shugnite stones in the sun every 6 months.**

Chakra
Crown
Throat
Third Eye
Amethyst carries a high, sweet energy, particularly stimulating to the Third Eye, Crown and Etheric Chakras. [Ahsian, 29]

The Brow Chakra, also called the Third Eye, is the center of our perception and command. It directs our sight and everyday awareness of the world. Our consciousness is located here, and we relate to ourselves through this chakra. When the Brow Chakra is in balance our thoughts and internal communications within ourselves are healthy and vibrant. We are open to new ideas, dreams, and visions, and can control the flow of energy within all the chakras. The dark blue/purple crystals of indigo are used to treat imbalances of the Brow Chakra. It is a quiet color, one of mystery and wisdom and judgment.

The Crown Chakra is located at the top of the head, and is our gateway to the expanded universe beyond our bodies. It controls how we think, and how we respond to the world around us. It is the fountainhead of our beliefs and the source of our spirituality. It connects us to the higher planes of existence and is the source of universal energy and truth. When the Crown is in balance, our energies are in balance. We know our place in the universe and see things as they are. We are unruffled by setbacks, knowing they are an essential part of life. Imbalances of the Crown Chakra are treated with Light Violet crystals. Their violet rays have the universal life force of magic, dreams, inspiration, and destiny.

It provides an ease in moving between the worlds, and permits a safe and grounded return to the present. [Simmons, 225]

Labradorite is also the most powerful protector of the mineral kingdom, creating a shielding force throughout the aura and strengthening natural energies from within. It protects against the negativity and misfortunes of this world, and provides safe exploration into alternate levels of consciousness and in facilitating visionary experiences from the past or the future. [Ahsian, 226]

As a workplace stone, Labradorite brings out the best in people, making work life more congenial. It encourages courtesy and full attention to the customer, and assists part-time and temporary staff in becoming fully involved in a company. [Eason, 163]

Labradorite calms an overactive mind and energizes the imagination, bringing in new ideas. [Hall, 170] 

It is a wonderful tool for returning joy and spontaneity back to one's life. It helps eliminate the emotional drain of daily routine or being weighed down by responsibility, and awakens a sense of adventure and change. [Eason, 163]

Labradorite is a powerful protector of the aura, preventing energy leakage, and others from tapping into and draining your personal energy. It ensures all elemental forces are empowered and proportional within one's system. [Ahsian, 226] 

It is also a useful tool in radionic analysis and treatment to help pinpoint problem areas. [Melody, 368][Hall, 170]

Labradorite's energy allows one to penetrate the veils of the Void, where all knowledge and possibility are held. It is the place of potential and the source of creation, and for shamans, magicians, and Light workers, Labradorite acts as a protective ally in recalling experiences from other realms, other times and other lives. It assists in moving between the worlds, and in bringing to this realm the creations which are for the highest good of all beings. [Ahsian, 226]

Referred to as the ""temple of the stars,"" Labradorite is thought to bring the light of other planetary beings to the soul of the user. Its labradorescence is believed to be of extra-terrestrial origins, and enclosed in the mineral to bring the evolved energies from other worlds to the Earth plane. [Melody, 367]

Chakras
Labradorite radiates a predominant blue crystal energy that stimulates the Throat Chakra, the voice of the body. It is, in essence, a pressure valve that allows the energy from the other chakras to be expressed. If it is blocked, or out of balance, it can affect the health of the other chakras. When the throat chakra is in balance and open, it allows for the expression of what we think and what we feel. We can communicate our ideas, beliefs, and emotions, bringing our personal truth out into the world. We have an easy flow of energy within the body and spirit. The energy that springs upward from the lower chakras can continue its path enabling free expression and natural release. Darker shades of blue encourage the power of truth, while lighter shades carry the power of flexibility, relaxation, and balance. Labradorite, with its iridescent flashes of color, can be very beneficial in uniting all of the chakras.

Golden Labradorite assists in opening the lower chakras during ritual or magical practices, while Spectrolite works with one's ""Rainbow Body"" to enhance awareness of the higher realms. [Simmons, 226]

Meditate with Golden Labradorite to open channels to the higher realms of archangels. Spiral through and above your hair to mend tears in your aura. [Eason, 102]

Meditating with Spectrolite raises consciousness and facilitates multi- and inter-dimensional journeying. Holding profound esoteric wisdom, it takes you into other lives and prepares the body and soul for ascension. [Hall II, 326]

Meditating with Labradorite allows one to recognize humanity as ""being of light,"" transcending limitations of the past and thoughts of the future, and embracing the infinite possibilities of the moment. It allows one to ""be"" and rest assured the light is always there, surrounding and pure. [Melody, 368]

The Divinatory meaning of Labradorite: You may have to temporarily make the best of a less-than-ideal situation, but soon will be able to do things your way. [Eason, 163]

Feng Shui
Labradorite utilizes Water energy, the energy of stillness, quiet strength, and purification. It embodies potentialities unrealized. It is yielding, formless, yet powerful. The Water element brings power of regeneration and rebirth. It is the energy of the circle of life. Use blue crystals to enhance any space that you use for repose, calm reflection, or prayer. Water energy is traditionally associated with the North area of a home or room. It is associated with the Career and Life Path area, its flowing energy assuring a balance of energy as your life unfolds and flows.

Legend and Lore
In ancient lore, Labradorite was considered to be a talismanic gem of winter, and in Oriental culture was known as a ""phenomenal gem"" to be worn on Saturdays. Phenomenal gems exhibited a moving line, star, or changes on the surface as the light varied, and was considered to bring good fortune to the wearer. [Kunz, 326, 333-334]
